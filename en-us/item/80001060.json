  "BgDescription": "Galbrena's unique dessert recipe features large scoops of ice cream over a bowl of shaved ice, topped with colorful jams for that extra kick in flavor, along with a portion generous enough to eat to your heart's content. She even took extra care to adjust the Tacet Discord-shaped candies and cookies to be more appealing and cute.<br>Perhaps there's a deeper reason behind it all: When dealing with Tacet Discords, one needs a sharp, decisive \"crunch.\" But when it comes to life, one should savor its flavors to the fullest. According to Galbrena, eating them separately or together comes down to personal preference. Her only advice is: Enjoy it before it melts. Many life's precious moments \"melt in an instant,\" just like the sprinkles of ice. But don't worry, delightful flavors cling to the taste buds and never fade, always there to enjoy.",
