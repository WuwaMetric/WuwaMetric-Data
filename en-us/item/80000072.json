  "BgDescription": "Thin slices of meat smoked over Creeping Torchpine needles are stewed together with the fermented drink, then served with mashed potatoes and a spoonful of Dusk Honeypot jam. The rich fat of the Kronapuff mingles with the firm, chewy Lemming meat, offering alternating waves of flavor. On a night when the cold wind cuts to the bone, one mouthful is enough to make you forget the coldness and the exhaustion that came with them.",
