  "BgDescription": "Zani's pasta is a rich and flavorful dish, made by layering hearty meat sauce with cheese, sausage, and fragrant herbs before cooking it to perfection.<br>According to what she said, she first stumbled upon the idea while reheating a takeout meal that had gone cold after a long workday. On a whim, she threw in whatever ingredients she had on hand, and to her surprise, the result was unexpectedly delicious. What began as a quick fix soon turned into a carefully refined recipe.",
