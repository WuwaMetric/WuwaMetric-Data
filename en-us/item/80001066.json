  "BgDescription": "An ordinary, traditional bread found throughout Septimont, even in the far-off town of Fabianum. Perhaps to set it apart, local bakers in Fabianum would sprinkle crushed herbs over the crisp crust and, with a sense of ceremony, carve the word \"Delicious\" into the surface, as if this modest declaration could lend it a hint of dignity.<br>Is it delicious? The young Augusta never thought so. To her, it was just the dry, hard bread waiting at home after a day of running wild, something to fill her belly, the quiet \"footnote\" to every dinner her mother made. It was plain, unremarkable. Like water. Like sunlight. So ordinary it was easy to overlook. But years later, standing before her own stove in Septimont, Augusta tried to recapture that long-forgotten taste. And as the familiar scent and gentle sweetness returned to her tongue, she finally understood what \"Delicious\" meant.<br>Perhaps, she had never truly bid farewell to her hometown.",
