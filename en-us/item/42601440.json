  "BgDescription": "Legend has it that the Waxweavers were once Solsworns, cursed for failing their sacred charge.<br><br>Day in and day out, they observe the light. Day in and day out, they weave the light. Their spinning begins with the first rays of dawn and concludes at the hour of twilight when the finished web is retrieved. This endless vigil continues, as if they are still desperately striving to fulfill the duty they abandoned, weaving a web of their own atonement.<br><br>For this reason, the Roya maintain a solemn, religious reverence and deep pity for the Waxweavers.<br><br>When melted, their silk can be applied to wounds to aid healing, or used as a water-resistant coating.",
