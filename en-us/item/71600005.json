  "BgDescription": "Water cascaded down the rock face, scattering into a fine mist that shimmered softly in the air. If Fa recalls correctly, they practiced playing the music here again and again with Matthew. When they finally succeeded, the melody carried them forward like flowing water. The color of \"Mi\" softened into green, and the photograph retained the memory of wind and water entwined, a light that still trembles gently, like dew on a blade of grass.",
