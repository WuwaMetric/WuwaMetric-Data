  "BgDescription": "A massive metal ring caught the light, its curves reflecting a warm, muted glow. Beyond it, the plains stood in silence. If Fa recalls correctly, it was here that Matthew taught them to recover the beat with their own steps. The bass drifted like the wind across open ground, rhythm lighting up within the Soliskin themselves. The photo preserves that moment when rhythm was rejoined, a faint tremor lingering in the sunlight.",
