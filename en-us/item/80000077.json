  "AttributesDescription": "A Startorch Academy cafeteria classic. It looks like a simple carb-on-carb combo, but it’s surprisingly addictive: a soft bun brushed with salad dressing, stuffed with sweet and savory fried noodles, topped with red pickled ginger for balance. Most people can’t stop at just one.",
  "BgDescription": "Created for Startorch Academy’s students and staff, this jelly is packed with balanced nutrients and fiber, offering steady energy and long-lasting fullness. Its nozzle is designed for easy use anywhere. You can customize the flavor, but be cautious when accepting homemade jelly from others. Not every creative flavor is pleasant for your tummy.",
