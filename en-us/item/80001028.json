  "BgDescription": "When Qiuyuan and his comrades were still in service, their missions often required them to travel fast and eat light, with little chance to enjoy a good meal. Even when they lodged at village inns, they still had to cook their own food out of an abundance of caution. Originally from Chongzhou, Qiuyuan had learned a few basic recipes at a young age. One of his dishes was fragrant, spicy, and mouthwatering, perfect for an empty stomach when paired with rice. Simple, yet satisfying. <br>\"Eat well, live well.\"",
