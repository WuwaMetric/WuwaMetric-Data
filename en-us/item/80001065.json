  "BgDescription": "Did someone pick these olives? Hardly. The branches, heavy with ripened fruit, simply yielded their bounty, dropping them gently into her waiting hands. No elaborate preparation could improve their natural, fresh flavor. A simple roll in honey is all it takes to satisfy her discerning palate: as the verdant aroma still clings to her fingertips, a wave of sweet freshness washes over her mouth.",
