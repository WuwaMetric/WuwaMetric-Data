  "BgDescription": "One of the traditional handmade drinks of Huanglong, implying \"double happiness\". The method of making it is simple, just dry the fresh Honeysuckle, stir-fry it with Lemongrass, and pour it into boiling water. Add a little Caltrop before drinking to add sweetness. The finished product is sour and sweet, with a slightly bitter aftertaste, which helps digestion, so it is often seen on the festival table.",
