  "BgDescription": "The red wasteland lay silent, like a seabed after the tide had withdrawn. The wind lingered, echoing endlessly across the surface. If Fa recalls correctly, this was where they first met Matthew. He was holding that strange object in his hands, which, with a single gentle pluck, let sound bloom into the night, bright and tender. It was here that the Soliskin learned how to enjoy music for the first time, and the photo quietly preserved that moment of first encounter.",
