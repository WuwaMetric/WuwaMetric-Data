  "BgDescription": "For a wandering bard like Ciaccona, meals on the road are all about striking a balance between taste and convenience.<br>One day, as the campfire crackled to life, she had an idea and took the bread she always carried.<br>As the rich aroma of meat sauce filled the air, seeping into the bread's warm crust, she spread on the final layer of seasoning.<br>However, there's an unspoken rule. Ragunna's pasta is not to be tampered with. No shortcuts, no twists. Taking a bite of her creation, Ciaccona was lost in her thoughts. \"If I ever get banished, this bread might just be one of the reasons.\"",
