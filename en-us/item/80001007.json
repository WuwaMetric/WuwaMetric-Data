  "BgDescription": "Chilled, diced fruit is put in ice water and sweetened with fresh nectar. The clinking ice cubes produce a clear, melodic sound. <br>Camellya made this fruit tea to her liking, with just a hint of milk and grapes as the base, subtly balanced by a splash of gooseberry juice. <br>The refreshing sweetness dances on the tongue, leaving a delightful aftertaste as the faint bitterness from the tea fades.",
