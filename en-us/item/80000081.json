They may not be the most balanced meal, but they’re undeniably one of the academy’s favorites.<br><br>The container has its own heating system, so just add drinking water and wait. If left too long and the noodles or the vegetables start multiplying unusually fast, please contact the Agronomy Wing for collection.",
