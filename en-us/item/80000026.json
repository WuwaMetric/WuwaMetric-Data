  "BgDescription": "A golden and crispy fish dish with a complex preparation process. The carp is styled to look up to the sky, as if it wishes to transform into a dragon. It is said that when the Jué descends, the big fishes in the ocean all resurfaced. In order to commemorate this wonderous sight, people serve it on the table during festivals, praying for a good fortune in the coming year.",
