Salted fish is packed into a jar and sealed with wet clay, allowing it to ferment and develop a strong, distinctive flavor. To eat it, one must crack open the top of the jar.<br><br>Before eating it, make sure to keep these things in your mind:<br>1. Always open the jar outdoors, in a wide and downwind spot.<br>2. Never open it indoors, in a warm place, upwind, or near a crowd.<br>3. Check the jar before eating. If you see a crack, put it down immediately and bolt.",
