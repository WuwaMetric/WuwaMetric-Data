  "Description": "The Fabricatorium of the Deep has stirred beneath the waves, its unrest quietly noted by the nobles and the Order. To prevent further disruption to the lives of the people of Ragunna and to avoid unnecessary panic, both sides held a rare private meeting. In an unprecedented move, they reached a consensus: a full re-survey of the facility must be conducted to inform joint discussions on the fate of the Fabricatorium and the Common Echoes it holds. As the only one to return from that place unscathed, you are undoubtedly the best person to lead this expedition.",
