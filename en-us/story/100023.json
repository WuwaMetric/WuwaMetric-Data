  "QuestDesc": "The Dreamer seals her heart and surrenders to a world of dreams beyond mortal sight. In this hidden realm built upon melancholy melodies, she walks a path of fragile hope and delusions without looking back. But the dreams she longs to realize have long been tangled up in shadow and deceit. Beneath the lofty facade of the Orchestrator, who seems to have everything, is but a wretched, pitiful soul, drowning in her own illusions.\n\nIn the end, will this dream of blooming and withering be a sweet reverie or a haunting nightmare?",
