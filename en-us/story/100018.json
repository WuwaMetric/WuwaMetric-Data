  "QuestDesc": "Sunshine, beach, ocean… and fish! Rinascita, surrounded entirely by the sea, thrives on its love for fishing. A young man named Ishmael will guide you to the Riccioli Islands, a fishing paradise like no other...\nA sailor named Starbuck has fallen into mental turmoil—rumor has it, a fish drove him to this state...\nHere, all fish gather—and since whales are also considered \"fish\", then...\nA long-dead captain, a ship that cannot sail. Yet now, that captain has set upon an inevitable course, and the ship must sail once again...\nIn a storm long ago, a captain and a whale sank beneath the waves together. Now, a similar storm rages, and the whale roams the sea once more…\nThe sea has calmed, but Captain Ahab and his crew are gone. Ishmael, who first brought you to the Riccioli Islands, seems to be studying the relics left behind by the legendary captain…",
