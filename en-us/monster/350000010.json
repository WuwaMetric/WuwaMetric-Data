Their names were not passed down, but their hymns were recorded and preserved by human beings. <br><br>Until one of them was deceased. The surviving one cried all day long, and the cries were so dismal it was called the Mourning Aix. <br><br>In the loss of a lover, the bird became oppressive and violent, allowing no one to step into its nest of lost love. It only lingers in the heavens while singing the eulogy, in pursuit of an illusion that is no longer there among the clouds.",
