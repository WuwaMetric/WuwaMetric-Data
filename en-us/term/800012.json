  "TermDesc": "Music is composed of frequency, as is everything. Thus, everything hums its own melody. Ciaccona's Forte allows her to perceive these melodies; by retuning them, she crafts a Sonoro Sphere in her hands where stories and memories carried in music replay themselves. The deeper her understanding of the melodies, the richer the stories she can summon."
