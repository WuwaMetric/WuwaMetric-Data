If <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Relative Momentum</span> reaches 100 during this time, cast <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Heavy Attack - Inversion</span> instead.<br>- While moving, Mornye continuously consumes STA. STA cannot be recovered while in <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Wide Field Observation Mode</span>.<br>- When Dodging with directional input, Mornye starts to fly at speed, which lasts for up to 10s or until STA is depleted or until the <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Wide Field Observation Mode</span> ends.<br>- When Mornye is hit or launched into mid-air, press Dodge to immediately recover from the attack. This effect can be triggered up to 3 times, which resets when <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Wide Field Observation Mode</span> ends.<br>- Press Jump and Mornye will slowly descend, before she lands, <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Basic Attack - Wide Field Observation Mode</span>, <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Dodge Counter - Wide Field Observation Mode</span>, <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Resonance Skill - Distributed Array</span>, and <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Heavy Attack - Inversion</span> are unavailable.<br>Performing environmental interactions, using Utilities, or switching to another Resonator ends <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Wide Field Observation Mode</span>. The state also ends when Mornye is no longer airborne."
