  "TermDesc": "A civilization located at the polar region of Solaris. Ancient shifts in the planetary axis redefined the world's geography, turning the Lahai-Roi region into what is now the planet's pole. Over time, the vast caverns deep beneath thick layers of ice and snow gradually became habitable for humankind. In this warm and humid underground haven stands an academic metropolis for Resonators, celebrated as the \"Research Haven of Solaris\" and a \"Utopia for Researchers.\""
