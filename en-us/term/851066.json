  "TermDesc": "This pale rainbow-colored light surging in the Sonoro Sphere of Honami City is a Waveworn Phenomenon unique to this place. Traces of Irideglow's corruption can be found everywhere in Honami. During periodic Lament outbreaks, Irideglow condenses into a physical form that cuts through space, capturing and devouring everything it meets within the Sonoro. Resonators with long-term exposure to Irideglow have high risk of losing control of their Resonance power, and may even Overclock."
