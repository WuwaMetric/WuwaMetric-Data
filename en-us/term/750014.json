  "TermDesc": "An installation that can be field-deployed to amplify the frequency produced by Anchor Stones. Once the Anchor Stone is inserted, it can generate an energy field to repel the Dark Tide and its creations.<br>During the hunts, Gladiators of Septimont strategically set up Anchor Obelisks carrying Anchor Stones at critical locations across Maroonwood, the main battlefield. These devices help them drive the Dark Tide and its creations toward the base of the Earthrend Wedge, where they are eliminated. The strategy has proven highly effective in preventing the Dark Tide's spread beyond the Earthrend Wedge's containment."
