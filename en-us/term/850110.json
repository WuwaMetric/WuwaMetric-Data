  "TermDesc": "Also known as the Civilization Simulation Sand Table, the Tethys System is a supercomputer unique to the Black Shores. By inputting Lament frequency data—collected both manually and via beacon access—into the system, the Black Shores can issue Lament warnings for locations worldwide within a 24 to 48-hour time range. This capability is the cornerstone of the Black Shores' extensive collaborations with countries across the globe."
