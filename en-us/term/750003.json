  "TermTitle": "Earthrend Wedge",
  "TermDesc": "A colossal wedge-shaped structure located in the lower levels of the Sanguis Plateaus. It descended from the high heavens alongside Rinascita's Sentinel Imperator, who had full control over it. When the first Dark Tide outbreak struck Rinascita, the Earthrend Wedge was activated. Its energy field effectively suppressed the Blightcloud above the hunting grounds, preventing it from spreading into Septimont's urban areas. Subsequently, the Dark Tide stemming from the clouds has been mostly contained within the lower levels of the Plateaus."
