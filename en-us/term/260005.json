  "TermDesc": "A Tidespawn created by Leviathan. It is a fusion of the frequencies of three powerful Tacet Discords: the great lion \"Nemea,\" the ancestral goat \"Pan,\" and the slippery serpent \"Python.\" Once Leviathan's \"first offspring,\" it now \"resides\" within Galbrena after merging with her frequency.<br>Within this fused being, the lion's brutal nature dominates Chimera's will, while the goat tempers its violence by feeding on human compassion. The serpent, sly and independent, appears loyal to Galbrena but secretly undermines her frequency."
