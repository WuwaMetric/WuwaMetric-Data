  "TermDesc": "When Zani is in the team and a nearby Resonator inflicts <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Spectro Frazzle</span> upon a target, immediately consume all Spectro Frazzle stacks and trigger the corresponding DMG, then convert Spectro Frazzle into equal stacks of Heliacal Ember. Every time the conversion happens, Zani obtains Blaze based on the stacks of Heliacal Ember inflicted. Heliacal Ember is capped at 60 stacks, with each stack lasting for 6s. Heliacal Ember stacks are counted toward the Spectro Frazzle stacks for the Eternal Radiance Sonata Effect."
