  "TermDesc": "A Waveworn Phenomenon unique to Rinascita, the Dark Tide is a manifestation of the Threnodian Leviathan's power of Unity. Dark clouds amass overhead and crash down like a waterfall, surging in all directions. Wherever the Dark Tide spreads, it spawns Tacet Discords and scars the land with Tidal Blight. At its epicenter, a new Tacet Field forms."
