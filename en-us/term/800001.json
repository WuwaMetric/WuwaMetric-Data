  "TermTitle": "Golden Anthem",
  "TermDesc": "Once a reputable poets society in Ragunna, consisting of three members: Faroll, Selena, and Rimbaud. They composed numerous anthems and poems glorifying the Sentinel and the Order, but were later accused of blasphemy by the Order and sent on a Pilgrim's Sail. They vanished thereafter without a trace, and mentioning of their names is now forbidden in Ragunna."
