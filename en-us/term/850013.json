  "TermDesc": "- While Electro Flare lasts, it deals periodic <span style=\"color:#ebb0ff;\">Eletro DMG</span> to the target. The target loses half of the effect stacks with each instance of damage.<br>- At maximum stacks of Electro Flare, any new stack inflicted becomes stackable Electro Rage.<br>- Electro Rage increases the DMG dealt by the next Electro Flare trigger. This effect is removed once triggered.<br>- Electro Flare and Electro Rage stack up to 10 times by default. The higher the stacks, the more DMG dealt."
