  "TermDesc": "An operation conducted by Septimont's Gladiators to eliminate the Dark Tide and its creations within the Sanguis Plateaus.<br>The Plateaus' unique terrain allows Remnant Energy to accumulate, sustaining the lingering Blightcloud hanging over the area, a remnant of the first Dark Tide outbreak in Rinascita. Consequently, the region has become a breeding ground for Dark Tide creatures, where the Dark Tide's corruption continues to spread unchecked.<br>As the confrontation with the Dark Tide stretched on, the Septimontians discovered a strategy to effectively curb the Dark Tide's advance: luring its creations toward the Earthrend Wedge and hunting them near its base. Since then, the \"hunt\" gradually evolved into an institutionalized tradition deeply woven into Septimont's culture."
