  "TermTitle": "Lahai-Roi",
  "TermDesc": "A warm, humid underground haven deep beneath the Roya Frostlands. Following an ancient polar shift that made Lahai-Roi Solaris's new pole, the changing climate drove the surface-dwelling Roya to migrate below. Long isolated, it became a refuge for extinct prehistoric life, which has since evolved into a unique and remarkably independent ecosystem."
