  "TermDesc": "The Sanguis Plateaus was once the Septimont frontline against the Dark Tide. Due to the region's unique landscape, Remnant energy gathers here in unusual density, along with a Blightcloud perpetually looming overhead, formed since the first Dark Tide. During High Tide seasons, Gladiators from across Septimont arrive here to hunt Dark Tide creations in the name of glory."
