  "TermTitle": "Celestial Steed",
  "TermDesc": "The autumn night's brightest constellation, shrouded in legends. A poet of Golden Anthem once wrote, \"I am a night hawk of wings aflame, soaring towards the Celestial Steed, whose praises I sing and whose true form I behold.\" Such imagery always evokes Rinascita's Sentinel. But why soar towards it and behold its true form? Maybe the poem was intended to convey some message."
