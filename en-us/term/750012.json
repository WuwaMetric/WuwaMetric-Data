  "TermTitle": "Griffrex",
  "TermDesc": "Native to the Septimont region, Griffrexes once coexisted with the ancestors of Septimont who sought refuge in Rinascita.<br>However, the outbreak of the first Dark Tide devastated the Border Mountains, the Griffrexes' habitat, driving most of the species to extinction. Since then, Griffrexes exist mostly as Common Echoes, which are generated at a fixed frequency from Resonance Beacons.<br>Over time, Septimontians became aware that these Griffrex Echoes still retained their instincts of hunting and sensing external frequencies. As a result, they were trained as Common Echoes for hunting purposes to track and attack Dark Tide creations."
