  "TermDesc": "The Tacet Fields that exist in isolated dimensions. <br>\"Tacet Fields\" are thought to be where all Tacet Discords originate. These locations feature a sky of inverted seas and a deep cross-shaped Tacet Mark on the ground. Reverberations fill the air, linking our world to an unknown space through a white Resonance Cord. These areas attract gatherings of Tacet Discords."
