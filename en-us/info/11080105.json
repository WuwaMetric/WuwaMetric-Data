  "Text": "The environment of the Secluded Forbidden Forest was even more magical than imagined. A unique canopy ecosystem has formed around the branches of this giant tree.<br> According to my research, the tree's branches contain an abundance of Resonance Energy, which is pooled from all around the Dim Forest area and travels from the top of the tree to the entire trunk. This energy catalyzes the formation of this massive tree. And it is through this energy that a whole different ecosystem thrives in the tree. Possibly because of the ferocious roars that come from within the tree from time to time, the tree shows no signs of large Mutant Organism with TD activity. This gives the plants a better chance to thrive and allows the Reverberation creature Mutterfly to exist.<br> The Resonator who made this giant tree is very similar to my Forte force. I'm sure he's a nature lover too. Otherwise it would be unlikely to create such a large and complex giant tree even with the added assistance of the Sound Emulator at the top of the tree.<br> In order to facilitate future expeditions, I made a small fluorescent decoration on the branches of the Claustrophobic Forbidden Forest as a signpost. This will make future scientific expeditions more efficient. Then it was time to set off and explore the depths of the Claustrophobic Forbidden Forest!",
