  "Text": "Chapter 13: The Contract of Doom<br><br>The Magistrate's menacing gaze pierced through the trembling woman like a hot knife through butter. \"Sign this here contract and you'll belong to me, my dear. And as long as you don't break any of the rules for the next three years, I'll make your ex-husband beg for mercy and pray for a swift death.\"<br><br>The woman crumbled to the ground in tears, her once glamorous face now stained with mascara. She clutched onto the papers like they were her last chance at redemption. In an ironic twist of fate, her former nemesis had become her savior. Her hair was no longer the envy of onlookers, but rather hung lifelessly around her face like a wilted flower. \"Fine,\" she choked out, \"but I have one condition.\"<br><br>The Magistrate leaned back with a smug smirk on his face. \"Go on,\" he purred.<br><br>\"That woman? She needs to disappear from this world,\" the woman demanded, a glint of revenge flashing in her eyes.<br><br>The Magistrate's brow furrowed in confusion as he watched her tears. \"Sure, \" he said quickly, lifting her up with one hand and causing her to stumble into his arms. As she struggled against him, the Magistrate's expression softened and a hint of amusement danced in his eyes.<br><br>\"Don't touch me!\"<br><br>\"Ha! Don't flatter yourself, sweetie,\" the Magistrate chuckled. \"I wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole.\"",
