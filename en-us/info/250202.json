  "Text": "Why do I forget? Is it the erosion of time, or some deeper failing…? I must inscribe these secrets. I must remember:<br><br>The Dark Tide descending from the sky is the Divine Ordeal. It is born from the shadows of our hearts, twisting faith to fuel its unjust force of destruction.<br>This unfathomable darkness has long shackled the Ragunnesi's subconscious mind, blinding them to the true righteous path.<br>On this journey of survival, the weight of the martyrs' sacrifices has become unbearable.<br>People cannot perceive what lies beyond their own consciousness. Yet I, who have glimpsed the truth, must use external force to restore the Ragunnesi to their true and complete selves.<br>From among the faithful, a powerful Harbinger shall arise, bringing both life and annihilation from the Dark Tide into this world. <br>Only by striking down this Harbinger, by descending into the depths of the darkness and using Their power to merge all the trapped souls into my own body, can I lead them all away from the Dark Tide.<br>The safe, undisturbed Lost Beyond shall be our new sanctuary. There, these souls shall find rest.<br>When tens of thousands of restored spirits unite as one to form a fortress of unshaken faith, believing together that it shall not come, then it will cease to exist.<br>Unity is our sole deliverance from the Divine Ordeal. Should the path falter, remember, \"The Lantern\" endures. It will guide you to the true light.",
