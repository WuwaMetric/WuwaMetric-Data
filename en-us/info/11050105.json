  "Text": "Date: AL154<br>Contents: In the operation to recover the Gorges of Spirits, Midnight Rangers encountered extremely unfavorable circumstances such as the death of the commander-in-chief and the disparity between the enemy and us. However, our warrior Jiyan was outstanding in battle, and fought against the large-scale TDTD Outbreak for three days with only a single special team left, and stood firm until the arrival of support from large troops, and then merged the military forces and successfully defeated most of the exploration results. The TDTD Outbreak was defeated in one fell swoop, and most of the exploration results were successfully preserved.",
