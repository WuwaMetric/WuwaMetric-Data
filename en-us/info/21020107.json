The Chest Mimic doesn't move on its own, so I suggest you stay away from this room until the guards arrive.<br> <br>(Below the note is a hastily scrawled line in a different handwriting)<br> <br>Don't even think about sending an Echo to inspect those storage chests. They'll just get gobbled up by the Chest Mimic... You really don't want to know how I found that out.",
