  "Text": "Brandon's not the only one who's gone missing. People have been disappearing left and right. Good thing I learned how to quickly memorize people's faces in school, otherwise I could've easily overlooked this.<br><br>Everyone here seems indifferent to these disappearances. They're not even remotely curious about where those people went, or what fate they'll suffer. They just go about their business numbly while enduring the dwindling food supply.<br><br>As for those masks, I'm now certain they're working for some bigshot who recently showed up in the Black Alley. They occasionally leave to return to Ragunna City. I try to keep my distance, but I once overheard something during one of their gatherings... they're a bunch of criminals. Thugs. They were in one helluva celebratory mood talking about the \"rebirth of the Black Alley.\" Whoever their boss is, she seems to be planning on making her fortune through crime.<br><br>But then what? What happens after the rebirth of the Black Alley? I haven't the slightest clue. To be honest, I normally consider myself a brave person, but I'm scared. Scared of that boss of theirs. Scared of her plans... I just want to leave now. Let the Chamber of Discipline deal with these criminals.<br><br>I did make an unexpected discovery today, though I can't tell if it's good news or bad news. I found an ID card in a tunnel near the ventilation shafts, something the residents of the Black Alley use to identify each other. It belongs to Brandon.<br><br>Did something happen to him? Or maybe... he left it there on purpose as some kind of guide? Or as a warning? Those masks are watching every move I make, I can't just make a break for it. Maybe Brandon knows a way out. I have to find him.",
