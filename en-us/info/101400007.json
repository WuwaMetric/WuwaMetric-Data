  "Text": "Sparrow here. Day 14 of our undercover investigation. Canary and I managed to get hold of the date and location of the transaction, but we've yet to find any key evidence.<br>Based on various intel, we suspect that Cuckoo has already planted a mole inside the nest. Meaning our cover could be blown at any given time.<br>With our hatchling barely out of its shell, I had instructed Canary to abort the mission and return to the nest for the sake of safety, to which she refused... She suggests that nowhere is safe if the mole has already planted a target on our backs, rather our optimal plan of action is to stick together and seek out the evidence and the mole as quickly as possible.<br>We have already entrusted the hatchling to the care of a junior with whom we place our complete trust. We now have no worries. We can and must bring evil to justice.",
