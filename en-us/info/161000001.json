Thea was right… That damn beast's heading straight for us. Guess it figured out ████.<br><br>We can still run. We've got just enough strength left to make it. But the children? They can't even get past the trenches. Once the walls fall, there's no question what happens to them.<br><br>…We were scum once. Sold our souls for money. But we bought them back along the way. ██ is interesting. Who'd have thought it? Us old outlaws, ██ for decades, picking up weapons again to guard Septimont.<br><br>Myzel's back is more bent than the sword he's gripping. Beccan's lance—the same one that carried him through a dozen wars—is just a walking stick now. I'm no exception. My vision's blurry. Don't know if I can still hit the target dead on like I once did as a ██. We were all ████ once. Time really doesn't pull its punches.<br><br>Before we left, we picked one of the older kids to come with us. If we ████ there, he's gotta make it back. Raise the alarm. Buy the others a chance to get out.<br><br>The ██'s close now. Well then, my old rivals… it's time. Time to meet ██ on the field.<br><br>I wish you, me, and everyone happy hunting.",
