  "Text": "Hi Rover,<br><br>I'm not sure if this message will reach you, but I hope it does.<br><br>There's something I've been wanting to tell you, but I can't seem to find the right words in person... To be honest, I'm afraid you might reject what I'm about to ask.<br><br>I'd like to give you this scroll of painting. It's not just because you helped me with Mingyan's situation, but also because you freed me from a worry that's been haunting me for years. The Patrollers returned the \"Serenity of Xiehua Village\" that I drew during the hearing, but I want you to have it now. After all, it's the reason we met, a testament to our shared journey, and a symbol of the courage you instilled in me. In a way, we created this painting together.<br><br>My heart will always be connected to this piece, and I must admit, I have an ulterior motive... I want it to stay with you.<br><br><alignright/>Zhezhi",
