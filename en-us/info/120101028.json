  "Text": "...We still haven't found it today.<br> <br>Such a large creature can't easily hide its tracks. Until we discover the location of its next appearance, we must not approach the shore, and no storm can stop us.<br> <br>The roaring sea, the storm as black as the ink spewed by a dying squid, the deck swaying in the tempest, masts drifting towards the shipwrecks in the Forgotten Sea, sailors with faces weathered by time, as deep and cracked as the ocean's trenches, the hundred-meter-long octopus... And we, the cursed hunters who pursue it to the ends of the earth.<br> <br>Think about it, what do we truly seek? I'll wager you this coin nailed into my leg.<br> <br>Now I will tell you how we shall achieve victory. We will chase it, across the Stormy Sea, through the Forgotten Sea, past every island, both named and unnamed, to the ends of the earth. Its blood and oil will make this coin worth a fortune.<br> <br>You, the spearman from the East, when you offer your spear to the gods, will you hesitate? Will the spear that once drank the blood of gods falter when facing the ocean? Come, raise your weapons high and cross them before me, just as you would in the arena! Let me see what glory you will embrace upon the waves!<br> <br>Bring me wine! Come, let us swear an oath to riches, to our dreams, to all that we've left behind!<br> <br>What we seek, what I seek… is that moment.",
