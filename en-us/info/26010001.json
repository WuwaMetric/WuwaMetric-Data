The glory of Septimont shall forever shine upon you—a true Gladiator.<br><br>Also, Mr. Aeolus, you were the seventh formidable opponent I faced on my path forward. Your swordsmanship and keen battle instincts left a deep impression on me. I will carry your blade, your ideals, and everything you stood for, and lead Septimont forward.<br><br>Please, bear witness.<br><br>With respect,<br>Ephor Augusta of Septimont",
