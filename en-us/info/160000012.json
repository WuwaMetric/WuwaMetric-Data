  "Text": "Talos had me and a group of guys on fixing and patching duty. Including the flooded area out front. The amount of effort it took to figure out how this drainage system works was something else. That thing that looks like a spiral staircase is actually a dead drainage outlet. I spent some time rerouting a power line to it, and now it's working properly.<br><br><color=yellow>There's an outlet on the central rotating column. Hit the switch and it activates. Once the water is drained, the path beneath will be accessible.</span><br><br>Best not to activate it unless absolutely necessary. Talos said it's the last line of defense against any intruders trying to get too deep into the Black Alley, so just keep it flooded unless our guys need to pass through.",
