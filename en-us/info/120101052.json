  "Text": "<span class=\"font-bold\">Day 159 – Sunny (A rare clear day)</span><br><br>Today, Chisa told me she found a new spot that could serve as a base—an old, spacious cafe. From the large terrace on the second floor, you can see a beautiful view of the city center. It's been a long time since I've seen her this excited. It feels like we're one step closer to breaking the loop.<br><br>And in fact, we are making progress.<br><br><span class=\"italic\">(The handwriting sharpens slightly.)</span><br><br>Based on my research over the past few days, I'm now fairly certain of this: the key to unraveling this endless Möbius loop lies at the heart of the city—Neon Tower. It is the center of the Lament. The origin. And most importantly, the point that lies closest to the outside world.<br><br>If we can reach the top, perhaps we'll be able to contact the people back at the Black Shores. Perhaps that's the way out of this Sonoro. The moss has already crept past the gears of my watch and reached the surface. Still, I haven't replaced it. It reminds me of time... and that something can keep pushing through falsehoods until it reaches the truth.<br><br>I'll head for the heart of Neon Tower tomorrow morning. If time here is clay, then I will mold it into a road, one that leads us home.",
