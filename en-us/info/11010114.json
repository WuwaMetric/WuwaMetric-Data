  "Text": "Here's Shiyu's stamp of approval: Shixia has officially reached the summit where this letter resides!<br><br>Shixia recently got accepted into the top school in Jinzhou and has set her sights on working for the Ministry of Development. She's come a long way and I can't help but feel proud and a little envious. Meanwhile, I'm still figuring out my own career path. Shixia joked about her intense studying habits again today, but I know she'll pass with flying colors — she's always been dedicated and doesn't even take breaks to hang out with me during vacation. I can hardly believe her good luck, but I couldn't be happier for her.",
