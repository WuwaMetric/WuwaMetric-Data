  "Text": "Today was a bittersweet day. I dropped off the kids and received a blurry picture from Annalika, showing a \"pocket piano\" she found, just like the one I discarded years ago. It turns out that the pocket piano in the Sea of Flames was actually a precious memento of my grandparents' love. They were separated during a battle and made a promise to meet at the sea of flowers, where they would leave the pocket piano as a token of their love. My brother has plans to sell it for SHC, but how can something so priceless be measured in gold? It's moments like these that remind me of how powerful and fleeting life can be. Thank you, two little ones, for showing me the true value of antiques in this modern era.",
