  "Text": "Those deemed faithless by the Order of the Deep are sent to voyage upon the Pilgrim's Sail, following the ancient path of those who once braved the mist and maelstrom seeking the Sentinel's guidance.<br><br>The Order claims that only Imperator can grant absolution to these transgressors. They must endure a grueling pilgrimage, suffering both body and soul until their repentance is complete. At the journey's end, it is said Sentinel Imperator will offer them forgiveness and the promise of new life.<br><br>But no one in Ragunna has ever heard of a faithless \"pilgrim\" returning from this sacred journey. The Order asserts that they reach Imperator's place of dwelling and devote themselves to Their service for eternity. While many still harbor doubts, few dare to openly challenge the Order—none wish to suffer the same tragic fate as those branded Fools.",
