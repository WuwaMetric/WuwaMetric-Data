  "Text": "On the same fateful day, both leaders of the Order, Napoli the First and Napoli the Second, received divine revelations. After deliberation, they agreed that Napoli the Second would embark on a pilgrimage befitting the revelations, while Napoli the First would remain behind to lead the faithful.<br><br>In the third year of Napoli the Second's departure, Napoli the First suddenly fell ill and died, leaving the Order leaderless. When the Fisalia family caught wind, a war over authority to interpret the faith was inevitable.<br><br>Many believed this conflict would continue indefinitely, but a Dark Tide broke the stalemate. Inexorable in its advance, the Dark Tide indiscriminately overran the homes of all Rinascitans. The Tacet Discords, which surged from the Tides, were so relentless that both warring sides found themselves exhausted and forced into retreat. As each side prepared for a desperate final battle, Napoli the Second returned from his pilgrimage with a sacred lantern-shaped relic which a flood of Divine Envoys emerged, turning the tide of battle.<br><br>Following this event, Napoli the Second's prestige soared. Recognizing that their situation was untenable, the Fisalia family initiated peace talks with The Order. The precise details of the negotiation have been lost to time, as only a handful were present when Napoli the Second entered the gate of Fisalia castle, bearing a tightly bound sword.<br><br>Following these talks, Napoli the Second's coronation as Primus proceeded without opposition, and governance of Ragunna transitioned to The Order of the Deep.",
