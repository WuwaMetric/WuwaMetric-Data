  "Text": "Day 16.<br>They all say that Rinascita's outer sea is riddled with dangers—storms, mist, reefs, and TDs that could swallow a ship whole. Some even claim that the world beyond Rinascita had already died in the Lament long ago, with only our isles left under Imperator's protection.<br>Pure rubbish.<br>They've let fear of the unknown take over. They think I'd never dare take a Gondola out to the open waters, saying I'm just a river rat full of big talk. Well, I'll prove I'm no coward like them!<br>Today I caught a fine fish. A good sign, I'd say, and a nice meal. Now I have the stars above to guide my way, what's to fear? Storms? Waves? Bring them on! As long as I have my Gondola, there is no place in Rinascita I can't reach.",
