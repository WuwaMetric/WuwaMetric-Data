  "Text": "Guided by the fluorescent plants, I discovered a large purple tree.<br>Considering its characteristic of resembling an entire forest on its own, I speculated that this tree is likely a sub-species of the Ficus genus. The mysterious purple color on its leaves remains unexplained and requires further research and verification.<br>Due to the season, I failed to collect samples of the flowers and fruits of this tree, and there were no traces of pollinating insects in the vicinity. Surprisingly, the Violuna Banyan hasn't been contaminated by the toxic spores. Many mysteries still surround it, waiting to be unveiled.<br>I am certain that this is the first time this tree species has been discovered, and I have temporarily named it the Violuna Banyan.",
