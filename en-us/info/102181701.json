It's in a soft blue silicone case, and the top-left corner is chipped. This is the fourth student ID I've lost this year. And just thinking about how my professor screamed, collapsed, and yanked out handfuls of her own hair while helping me replace the last one… I honestly don't have the courage to ask her again. If anyone finds it, please contact me or just drop it off at the station's Lost and Found. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!<br><br>[From \"ChangeTheWorldWithLightEnergySciences\"]<br>…So you lost your ID again? Also, what do you mean \"screamed, collapsed, and yanked out handfuls of her hair\"? It paints a vivid image, but since when have I ever done that?<br>Stop looking. You have a project. I already requisitioned a replacement. <span class=\"font-bold\">This is the last one</span>. Come get it.<br><br>[From LostStudentID]<br>P-Professor?! Um... maybe I should wait a few more days? Someone might find it… no need to trouble you…<br><br>[From \"ChangeTheWorldWithLightEnergySciences\"]<br>Think again. My office. Now.",
