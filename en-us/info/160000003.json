He says this stuff must've been sitting there since the Dark Tide, at least twenty years ago. Must be emergency supplies people stocked up out of panic. Good thing they packed the jars with salt, so they're still edible.<br><br>Pickled Fish – Sixteen jars. Brandon gathered a group and fished them out of the sewers leading to the sea while those masks weren't looking. Gotta keep these jars hidden, or else they'll be taken away like the rest of our food if they find them.",
