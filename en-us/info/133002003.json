  "Text": "The Carnevale is the grandest celebration of Ragunna, where the masquerades never end, wine flows like rivers, and music pulses through the night. During this time, people cast aside the weight of the world and surrender to the wild, unrestrained joy of the festival.<br><br>The Carnevale's origins trace back to Sentinel Imperator, who once guided the people of Rinascita. It began as a tribute to Their grace, a celebration where laughter and performance became the purest form of reverence.<br><br>At the peak of the Carnevale, the Sentinel is said to manifest and crown the finest performer with the \"Laurel.\" This honor grants the bearer the privilege to commune with the Sentinel and hear Their wisdom.<br><br>Yet, a decade ago, the Carnevale was brought to ruin. A monstrous sea beast, rogue Echoes, and Tacet Discords swept through the festival, turning revelry to ruin. Only when Primus Fenrico intervened did the chaos subside. He proclaimed it was Sentinel Imperator's divine retribution for the Ragunnesi's indulgence and forsaking of their faith. Since then, the Carnevale has not been held again.",
