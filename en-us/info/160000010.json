One sip will send a cool rush from head to toe, like stepping into a ventilation shaft after an ice-cold shower!<br>Recommendation: ☆☆☆☆<br><br>Dragon's Breath Octane: Featuring Pavo Plum juice swiped from the docks and a spoonful of real fossil fuel, this fiery mix is for the boldest drinkers! Dare your friends to survive the burning journey from throat to stomach. First one to take a sip of water picks up the tab!<br>Recommendation: ☆☆☆<br><br>Biohoard: A concoction made from pickled fish and corned meat juices. Tastes just as bad as it smells. I don't know how anyone could enjoy this, but it was made on request from an anonymous letter... Anyway, makes for a good prank on your friends!<br>Recommendation: ☆<br>To the anonymous requester: Your drink is ready. Please pay for it soon, or I'll tell Talos and she'll find out who sent this letter.<br><br>Golden Hour Special: A special blend of Tumbleyak butter and Nectarwine. A perfect fusion of the rustic charm of Whisperwind Haven and the sophisticated taste of the Montelli Quarters. Some might find it lacking a bold kick, but trust me, the creamy bubbles and velvety texture will win you over.<br>Recommendation: ☆☆☆☆☆",
