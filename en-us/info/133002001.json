  "Text": "A nation of independent city-states scattered across a vast archipelago, with no central administrative center. Legends speak of Rinascita's founders, who fled their homeland and sailed to these islands to escape the Lament. <br><br>As an island nation reborn from the Lament, Rinascita was long isolated from the rest of the world by relentless disasters and vast distances. It wasn't until recent times that the Rinascitans opened new maritime routes. Ships laden with their spices and minerals began to sail across the world, and in turn, new treasures and wealth began flowing back to Rinascita, enriching its shores.<br><br>Rinascita is famed for its unique \"Common Echo\" technology, which allows Echoes to persist in physical form within the radius of the Genesis Nexus. Through this technology, the Rinascitan people have integrated Echoes into every facet of their lives. This is how the nation came to be known as the \"Land of Echoes.\"<br><br>Rinascitans place great value on the identity derived from bloodlines, and their society is built upon a deep reverence for family ties. For them, the welfare of the family always takes precedence over individual fate.",
