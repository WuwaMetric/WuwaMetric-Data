The researcher ■■■ used the power of the \"Collective Factor\" and successfully connected with ■■, obtaining information about the history of this place and ways to calm ■■ down. However, the connection was too strong for ■■ to sever on her own, so the other team members forcibly awakened ■■ while calming ■■. After ■■■ completed the report recording, he experienced hallucinations, blurred consciousness, and loss of consciousness, and lost his vital signs an hour later.<br>The ■■■ Intercity Ground Rail Station was assessed to be extremely dangerous and was sealed off and cleaned up with immediate effect, with all survivors of the ■■■ Squad under special observation.",
