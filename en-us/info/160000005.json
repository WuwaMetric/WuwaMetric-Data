  "Text": "That woman who calls herself Talos took all of our food and forced us to obey her commands. She said this was the way of the Black Alley of old, where strength determines power and wealth, and the weak have no place. This order existed ten, twenty years ago, and even long before that. Brandon and the others tried to challenge her, hoping to liberate us from her \"rule,\" but they failed. That was the last anyone ever saw of them.<br><br>Oh, I've heard plenty of stories about the Black Alley, all right. The evil they committed. How they eventually received the judgment and punishment they had coming for them. All we wanted was a peaceful life in the Black Alley. We never wanted to be like them, wreaking havoc in the city. We just want to live our own lives here. The Black Alley is our home.<br><br>I have a plan in mind. If all goes well, then I can escape this miserable dump. I heard that a hero named the \"Blazing Nightwalker\" took out the previous gang. Maybe I can find her and ask her to save the Black Alley again.",
