  "Text": "We stopped at the edge of Sea of Flames and the two siblings nodded to each other as if confirming something. Then the boy pulled a small, delicate box out of his Backpack, and after only a moment's hesitation cast its contents into Sea of Flames.<br>Soon the long utensil melted away in the searing heat, and by the time I turned my head, the two siblings were crying little tears.<br>I've traveled all over the world and I'm not afraid of anything, but I'm most afraid of little kids crying, so it was good to see that I had put the blown up doll in the treasure chest before, and after I took it out and coaxed it, the little kid stopped crying.<br>Although this old thing did not get into the tower, it is also considered to make the best use of it, there is a value.",
