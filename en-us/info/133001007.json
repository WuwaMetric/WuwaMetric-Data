  "Text": "These stabilizing devices are strategically positioned throughout the surface and underground parts of the Black Shores. Their primary function is to calibrate and stabilize the frequencies of the giant Tacetites that make up the island, effectively isolating the Tethys System's virtual layer from reality. Additionally, these Anchors facilitate communication and carry the responsibility of observing the Etheric Sea, eliminating the need to build a Nexus Tower in the Black Shores.<br><br>The Anchors are independently developed and designed by the Black Shores, drawing inspiration from the reactor control rods used in pre-Lament reactor engineering. They are considered exemplary models of the Black Shores' minimalist engineering design.",
