  "Text": "Cartethyia smiles quietly. Watching her puts a smile on you, too.<br><br>After twenty years in her solitary confinement, she’s finally stepped out of that tower—back into the warmth of the crowd, into the embrace of sunlight and zephyrs. This is the moment she's been longing for through her turbulent years as the Blessed Maiden: to experience the mundanity of life, as Cartethyia, the Wandering Knight. And those three wishes she once made? They came true because you were there with her.",
