  "Text": "Date: [---].<br>I am Victor. This is a routine voice journal.<br>Today is another beautiful day. Most of the researchers have left. They will leave Mt. Firmament. Mr. Bram and I advised them to calm down and at least wait until we resolve the issue of shortened lifespan before making a decision. But they didn't listen.<br>I didn't leave. Research requires perseverance, which was the first lesson Mr. Bram taught me. He always leads by example. Ha, to him, I'll always be that immature young boy.<br>Date: [---].<br>I took some time to create something new: a simple AI. I named it Caleb after the iron-headed thing who traveled with a man and dog in an old movie I watched as a kid. Not many people are left here, so someone has to take care of the minor work. An AI is always useful.<br>I also created some interesting rock puzzles, powered by the many unoccupied Chronosorters in this place. It reminds me of playing with building blocks in my childhood. Those were the days. However, Mr. Bram doesn't seem very happy. Maybe his age prevents him from accepting too many new things...? Or perhaps his worsening leg condition makes these rock puzzles a hassle for him to navigate.<br>I don't mind. Life isn't just about work and research, right?<br>Date: [---].<br>It is quite enjoyable to educate an AI from scratch. It's like painting on a blank canvas—I need to stay focused to avoid turning a meticulous artwork into a careless scribble.<br>I answer any questions it raises and write new database entries for it every few days. I teach it everything I know about the world, using the methods Mr. Bram taught me. This feeling... is wonderful. Its camera reflects the world as I see it, and it thinks with my logic, allowing me to examine myself again through its actions.<br>Date: [---].<br>Caleb learns quite quickly. Initially, I only intended for it to help with cooking and tidying up the facility. I never expected its potential to far exceed our imagination. It seems that it is time to change its title from \"Life Assistant\" to \"Research Assistant\".<br>Mr. Bram has been ill for several days, bedridden, and unable to go anywhere. I miss the energetic man who used to scold us apprentices one by one. But now I have become a middle-aged man myself, too. It's been days since I last shaved, but it seems trivial now.<br>Date: [---].<br>Mr. Bram… didn't make it through that long winter.<br>Caleb and I buried him on a hill nearby without a tombstone. It wouldn't help anyway, as no one will know who we are or what our names are. People might just laugh about how a bunch of lunatics indulge themselves in illusions when they see our negligible legacy.<br>Caleb was with Mr. Bram until his very last moment. And Mr. Bram… taught it everything he knew. I understand why.<br>I once read a story about a man who was determined to level a mountain, despite everyone thinking he was out of his mind. But he made it, with the help of his sons, his grandsons, his great-grandsons, and so on.<br>I hope Caleb will shoulder this responsibility. I've told it about this. Human life is too short, but Caleb is immortal. It might accomplish what is impossible for us.<br>I will not live to see that day, but I will do everything I can while I'm alive to press forward. I promise, in the name of Bram, my mentor.",
