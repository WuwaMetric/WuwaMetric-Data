  "Text": "Master Dollmaker,<br><br>Do you remember this notebook? You said it was a gift from my parents when you became a Patroller. It contained their wisdom and advice, and it was your most treasured possession. It was my greatest inspiration, too.<br><br>I've completed my training today. I am now a qualified Patroller. I've decided to become an undercover agent, following in my parents' footsteps. While this may deviate from your expectations of me advancing in the Public Security Bureau, I feel drawn to this path. I may not come back here very often from now on. <br><br>Lately, I've been hearing worrying rumors from the Séance Society. I understand you're facing challenges in your research, but if you've resorted to working with criminals, then you'll be no better than them.<br><br>If you stumble upon this message in our camp, please destroy it after reading. I don't know if you'll ever find it, but I hope you do.<br><br>I miss our talks, Master Dollmaker. I've been thinking about my parents, and there is something I have to tell you. Please, let's talk again.",
