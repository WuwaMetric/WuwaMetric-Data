  "Text": "Hello, stranger!<br>If you're reading this message, you must have been selected as the first audience member of our Chelonian Dance Troupe!<br>A long time ago, I stumbled upon an instrument that can work miracles—the melodious music it plays can make me, animals, and even Tacet Discords dance to its tune. Of all the dances, the dance of tortoises is the most moving.<br>Since I was a child, I've always dreamed of becoming a performer who sings and dances. Unfortunately, probably due to my lack of talent, I've never been able to sing and dance well despite how much time and effort I've devoted to my training.<br>However, the moment I saw the tortoises dance, I set a goal for myself—to found a dance troupe!<br>With my guidance, the Chelonian Dance Troupe has been established for some time now, and our members' rehearsal efforts are beginning to bear fruit.<br>Now, it's time to pick up the instrument and let the music play!<br>Let's get moving, Chelonian Dance Troupe! Show the audience a dance they will never forget!<br>—Founder of Chelonian Dance Troupe",
