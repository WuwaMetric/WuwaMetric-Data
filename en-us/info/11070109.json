  "Text": "In AL157, the largest TDTD Outbreak in Huanglong's history, the \"Giant Wave TD Outbreak\", appeared and pushed into Jinzhou's hinterland.<br>In order to save the homeland on which mankind relies on for survival, all Huanglong troops stood by and defended the last line of defense.<br>Among them, the Midnight Rangers' vanguard brigade went deep into the core area of the field to carry out a campaign to eliminate the enemy. They sacrificed their lives for The Price to Pay, successfully reversing the passive defense situation on the battlefield and laying the cornerstone for Huanglong's final victory.<br>This cemetery is dedicated to the memory of the 306 soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the battle of Huanglong TD Outbreak.<br>                                                                                                                        --From all the people of Huanglong.<br><br>Supplementary Announcement: In AL159, after the completion of the cemetery, there were many mourners, and the sound of mourning condensed, causing the surrounding Wuthering Waves to be disorganized, triggering a small Tacet Field Outbreak, and damaging various parts of the Memorial Cemetery to varying degrees. Plans were made to refurbish the site, but the public wanted to keep the remnants in place in order to serve as a wake-up call that the crisis was not to be forgotten.",
