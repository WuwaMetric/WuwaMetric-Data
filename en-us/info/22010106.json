  "Text": "(Most of the contents have been lost. Only the preface remains relatively intact.)<br> <br>You'll easily pick out students from the Fisalia family at the Seminary.<br> <br>Not because there are many of them, but because they simply stand out. Fisalia students tend to be brooding and solitary, always slightly apart from the energy around them. Just as people from Ragunna expect them to be.<br> <br>Among students, rumors circulate: that the Fisalias poison their own meals to build resistance, that they travel via an underground cable car, and that they swim like fish. Only one of these is untrue. Still, the fact that people believe them shows how deep prejudice runs, even here at Avinoleum, where elites from all corners gather.<br> <br>I'm not from the Fisalia family myself, but I've befriended several. These Avinoleum-based Fisalians live closer to the family's ancient mission than most of their kin. As our bond deepened, a question began to take root in me, growing into an uncontrollable curiosity: Why does this venerable, illustrious family endure society's slander without protest? They no longer argue. They keep their silence. Only in their troubled dreams might you catch a whisper—broken phrases—hinting at the truth behind the veil.<br> <br>What are the Fisalias hiding? Or rather, what have they been carrying? The events and interviews collected in this book have been recorded with the consent of those involved, with sensitive details omitted. If, by the end of this book, you find yourself with a different understanding of the Fisalias, then this work will have served its purpose.<br> <br>...",
