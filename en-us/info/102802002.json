  "Text": "(A tourism guide penned by the Pioneer Association. But the column about Egla Town hasn't been updated in quite a while.)<br><br>[The Next Big Travel Hot Spot]: Egla Town!<br>For those brave enough to venture to the place that inspired the adventurous plays during the Carnevale, exploring the legendary realm of the mighty \"giant,\" listening to the songs echoing from the sea of clouds by the water, or following in the footsteps of knights in pursuit of honor and justice will no longer be mere fantasies. In Egla Town, travelers can immerse themselves in breathtaking waterside scenery, observe the majestic migration of Tumbleyaks, and watch windmills spin gracefully on the plains, while bathing in the golden light of the setting sun. Alternatively, they can simply enjoy a peaceful afternoon tea and indulge in century-old delicacies, all while being surrounded by the vibrant colors of blooming flowers.<br><br>[Dreamy Destinations] Nimbus Sanctum!<br>In this edition of [Dreamy Destinations], we journey to the mesmerizing Nimbus Sanctum hidden deep within Whisperwind Haven. A highlight of the enchanting Gondola cruise, the sea of clouds has long been a must-see destination, captivating visitors with its ethereal, dreamlike vistas.<br>Yet, few are aware that the Atrium of Reflections—often depicted in romantic tales—is not merely a creation of fiction, but the ruins of the highest spire of ancient Ragunna. To save its people, Napoli the Second invoked a miracle, turning the Dark Tide into the very sea of clouds that graces the land today.<br>The forgotten ruins of old Egla Town are now submerged beneath the sea of clouds.<br><br>[The Journey is the Destination] Embark Today!<br>It's worth noting that, although the reason remains unclear, the water level of Nimbus Sanctum has been steadily rising over the past decade, forcing the residents of Egla Town to move to the higher ground in the north.<br>Once, this area was a barren, undeveloped land, scattered with exposed boulders, and known as the Whisperwind Barrens.<br>However, the resourceful people of Egla Town began to build windmills that turned day and night, drawing water from the lower regions to nourish the land above. Their efforts transformed this rugged place into the thriving Whisperwind Haven we see today, where crops and flowers now flourish in the breeze.<br><br>[Column Memories] Voice of Travelers!<br>Your Egla column hasn't been updated since last Carnevale. It's just the same article over and over. You guys can't afford to pay the writer or something?<br>Could it be that no one's interested in Egla Town? Really? Am I actually right?<br><br>(A short novel published ten years ago.<br>\"An outrageous best-seller, banned by the Order three times!\"<br>\"Only one-tenth of readers truly understand it—are you one of them?\"<br>\"Incredible! The Russellian's satire remains as insightful as ever, even after all these years!\"<br>So reads the editor's recommendation page… Clearly, this book stirred up quite a bit of controversy a decade ago.)<br><br>Far out across the stormy waters filled with jagged ridges and giant beasts on the surface of Solaris lies a group of small, unregarded islands. On this archipelago, the exiles-descended cultures are so amazing that they still think a unified thought is a pretty neat idea. These islands have—or rather had a problem, which was this: most of the people on them were unhappy for pretty much of the time.<br><br>After retirement, I kept thinking back to that afternoon when my friend and I first met.<br>Ford Percival. He was an alien.<br>On his first day in Egla Town, he ate ten baton bread without paying anything. Before the Divine Envoys could punish him for theft, I quickly paid off his debt.<br>Since the prayer, the Oracle of Mercy had wandered in my mind in search of something to connect with—until I met him, the poor outlander. He must have been starving.<br>\"Hi, I'm Ford. I'm an alien. I'm analyzing your weapons. Quite odd components.\"<br>He said after I saved him. \"And what is this place?\" he continued.<br>An alien? Oh, I'd heard this kind of tale once from someone who claimed to be from a federation. He said Solaris was actually a living tomato—a tomato that could turn, breathe, even dance. And aliens, apparently, were from other tomatoes, living or dead.<br>\"Egla Town,\" I replied.<br>\"Egla Town, good. Wait, what is that?\" He pointed at the windmills in the distance.<br>\"Those are windmills. A cluster of Cyclop windmills, Briareos.\" Born and raised in Egla, I replied almost instinctively.<br>\"C-Cyclops! Ah, I know about those! I've seen them before! But my stars—you actually managed to kill them? How did you people pull that off? Are those auto-rotating arrays made from their dead bodies? And what exactly is Briareos? A cooling device? A propeller engine? Or something to open up a network channel?\"<br><br>(Continued)<br><br>After hearing my explanation, the self-proclaimed alien Ford seemed completely fascinated by the Cyclops. His emotions became so agitated that he plopped down on the ground, muttering some unintelligible words while pointing at the windmills in the distance.<br>So it was true—no matter where they came from, no matter what \"tomatoes\" they hailed from, anyone who laid eyes on the scenery of Egla couldn't help but fall in love with the chivalric literature.<br>So I straightened up, took three steps forward, and adjusted the nonexistent necktie, then explained graciously, \"Exactly! That's right! Once, a righteous knight guided us to defeat the giant. Before that, all the people and Echoes in Egla Town were driven to the high ground in the south, fleeing from the giant's threat. Now, that oppressor lies buried beneath the sea of flowers. We built majestic windmills to irrigate the flowers and the farmlands, and named our past home Briareos, in honor of that knight's heroic deeds!\"<br>After hearing my speech, Ford sat frozen on the ground, as if ten thousand Cetus the Tidebreakers had roared at him all at once, shattering his perception.<br>After a long pause, he asked me in disbelief, \"Do you still have knights here?\"<br>What did he just ask me?<br>Praise be to Imperator!<br>I could finally deliver the ranked No. 1 answer in the Top 10 Most Satisfying Moments for Egla People.<br>Putting on a solemn expression like the Acolytes of the Order, I envisioned a halo of nobility above my head, envisioned the almighty Imperator spreading wings before me, envisioned myself crowning a laurel at the Carnevale, envisioned standing in the grand church, wielding a sword as I was knighted, relishing the reverent gazes of the noble lords of Ragunna!<br>I replied, stressing each word with great emphasis:<br>\"OF COURSE—\"<br>\"However, there are too many outsiders who seek the path of knighthood. Are you confident enough to accept the trial?\"<br>The alien named Ford, whose Tacet Mark was blinking along excitedly, quickly grabbed my calf and shook it furiously, as if clinging to a log in the midst of a drowning. He cried out, \"I am! I am! Please guide me to the legendary knight! As long as I can return to the planet Russel and save my hometown, I am willing to pay any price!\"<br><br>(The trial chapters end now.

Such is the clout of Trattoria Margherita in Ragunna!<br>Amazing!<br>But what many don't know is that Trattoria Margherita is actually a family-run restaurant inspired by traditional Ragunna cuisine. From our investigation, we found that Egla Town still preserves this classic culinary tradition to this day. To maintain the special flavors of her dishes, Miss Margherita even takes time off to gather ingredients in Egla Town or Riccioli Islands!<br>Now, you might be wondering: \"What? I can understand why Miss Margherita would go to Riccioli Islands for the fish harvest, but Egla Town? Isn't that a backwater town? And can the cuisine of Egla really be called Ragunna cuisine?\"<br>Indeed, life in Egla isn't as thrilling as in the bustling Ragunna. People there live quietly, following the rhythm of nature. The town's trade and logistics are tied to Ragunna City. The people rise with the wind and rest by it, living a life shaped by windmills, wheat farms, and pastures.<br>But that's exactly why, for hundreds of years, the cuisine of Egla has remained unchanged. Here, the original flavors and cooking techniques of Ragunna have been preserved—using windmills to process crops and cooking food in traditional ways.<br>\"This way, the ingredients and the food are especially precious! The cheese made from local pastures is creamy, and the meat is tender and flavorful! It's the perfect food to fill your belly!\"<br>Miss Margherita commented during our interview.<br><br>[Comments from Special Guests]<br>Former Tax Envoy of the Order: The traditional cuisine is a remembrance of Rinascita's past. To forget it is to betray our heritage!<br>Orlando the Gourmet: The old man earlier sounded like he was chanting a slogan! What traditional cuisine? The bread from your town is as hard as a lethal weapon!",
