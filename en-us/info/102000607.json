  "Text": "... very few people, including those within the Montelli family know when the Vitreum Dancers first appeared, even though these unobtrusive, unremarkable Echoes have long served the family. In fact, most of the Montellis do not know of Vitreum Dancers as anything other than their domestic security detail. Thus it remains easily overlooked that no two Vitreum Dancers are alike.<br><br>Knowledge gleaned from the stained-glass artwork found in the ruins around Ragunna suggests that Vitreum Dancers were once Tacet Discord frequencies. They appear in stained-glass art along with general depictions of The Order's religion. To this day Montelli explorers have yet to find two identical panes of stained glass. The Order's artists took pains to alter the composition of panes that depict the same story or motif. This suggests that the frequencies of modern Vitreum Dancers each contain unique information, much like their Tacet Discord forbearers.<br><br>According to the book \"The Wealth and Legend of the Montellis,\" the origin of the Vitreum Dancer dates back in history to a time when a Montelli ancestor received the Laurel during the Carnevale from Imperator who then instructed him to go to a tower abandoned by The Order. Upon his return, he would not divulge what he saw and forbade all Montellis from approaching the tower again. Undoubtedly this Montelli ancestor brought back the very first Vitreum Dancer. On his deathbed, his last words were that the Sentinel's Oracle would not exert influence over Montellis at present, but would determine their future course of events.<br><br>And with that the tower was barred to all subsequent Montelli, and as the family's cohort of Vitreum Dancers expanded, the legend of their origins faded into obscurity.",
