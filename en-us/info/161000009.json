  "Text": "...<br><br>It's certain now. Something unnatural is happening outside. Every exit is sealed by forces not of this world. Iaen and I have no way out. Whispers claw at my ears. Only the pain of my wounds is keeping my mind from slipping away. This journal will likely be my last testament.<br><br>Here's the truth I've choked on for too long. Flavio and I, we swore to face off fair and square in the Colosseum finals, to settle our rivalry the right way. But the night before, his House sent someone to me with a message to hold back if things got rough. The offer came with better money than the prize, and a promise to find the best doctor for my ailing sister. I said yes... sold my honor as cheaply as those scum hunting Iaen. I disgraced that sacred fight with a pathetic show, and he saw right through me. I've never seen a man look so disappointed. In me, in his House, and in the arena itself. He vanished into the wilds and never returned.<br><br>After my sister passed, I tried to find him in Septimont. Thought I could square the debt and give him a real fight. As I write these words, I realize it wasn't just guilt that led me here. It was regret that I never faced him as a true Gladiator. Now I'll never have the chance.<br><br>I'm leaving this to Iaen. It will outlive me, no doubt. If someone ever reads these words, know they are the last confessions of Levis. I pray that Flavio, wherever the wilds have taken him, has found the glory that he deserves.<br><br>May applause greet all who walk the path of glory.",
