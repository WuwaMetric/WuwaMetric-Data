  "Text": "Gryphon's Fortress, Gryphon's Fortress, I feel thee near,<br>In winds that stir the banners gold, their song I hear.<br>The shining banners lift and dance, and sing of battles won,<br>Across the ink-dark tides, through rivers red as blood, and me on the ground.<br>With them comes the golden triumph, and my mother's call,<br>With banners high, let winds arise, and bear me far from all.<br><br>Gryphon's Fortress, Gryphon's Fortress, I clasp thee tight,<br>From waters deep, from the lake asleep in the hush of night,<br>From the streams that flowed through my mother's braids<br>From the blood-stained water dripping from my brother's blade,<br>Those waters rise to meet me now, and they will stay, your steadfast aid.<br><br>Gryphon's Fortress, Gryphon's Fortress, I will shield thee well,<br>With lake and sea and blood of mine, a sacred, binding spell.<br>The dark tides shall never touch thy breast,<br>The dark tides shall never wash over my mother's hair,<br>The dark tides shall never bring thy end!<br>Gryphon's Fortress, O Gryphon's Fortress, in the unsetting sun you gleam,<br>Forever kissed by whispering breeze, like an eternal dream.",
