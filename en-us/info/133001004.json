  "Text": "Based on the computational protocols of the Tethys System, the Stellar Matrix is a data package format that functions similarly to a highly compressed file. It has the capacity to store immense amounts of information and even simulate a Lament. Certain individuals can access these matrices under specific circumstances, making them an integral part of the Tethys System's operational framework.<br><br>Properly functioning Stellar Matrices are projected into the subterranean galaxy of the Black Shores, allowing members to study and observe them. Malfunctioning matrices, however, are collected and isolated in designated areas to prevent data overflow.<br>The first member to define a Stellar Matrix noted that standards of observing and evaluating one are similar to the astronomical standards of Solaris-3.",
