  "Text": "This is my fifth day in the Black Alley. People here are always on edge like they're afraid of something. No one says a word about it, of course.<br><br>The Black Alley is an oddity to the Ragunnesi. Youngsters these days don't even know it exists, while the old consider it a forbidden territory. Imagine the uproar it would cause in Ragunna if I wrote about its secrets and published them!<br><br>I met a nice fellow—everyone calls him the Runner, although I'm not sure who's pulling his strings. Thanks to his help, I got access to the Black Alley and its many mysteries.<br><br>The first three days of my investigation came up empty. But I did get to know a young man named Brandon over a game of pool. Seems like he's spent his fair share of time here. To be honest, he's damn good at the game, a worthy opponent, as long as he isn't cheating. Last time we played, the coat I had hanging nearby suddenly started burning. Luckily, I put it out in time, but by the time I came back, he had \"scored\" three points while I was gone.<br><br>Brandon is really tight-lipped about the Black Alley and always seems preoccupied with something. Still, I believe he could be the breakthrough I need in my investigation. He's not as stubborn as the old timers, nor as much of a pain to talk to as those masks. I still can't figure out where they came from. Maybe I'll figure it out someday.<br><br>Speaking of which, I haven't seen Brandon for two days. Maybe he went to help the starving old folks. As I learned during my investigation, the people here scrape by with odd jobs, barely managing to get enough food. Brandon is always sharing his rations with them.<br><br>Wherever he's gone, he'll be back for more pool. All I need to do is wait for him.",
