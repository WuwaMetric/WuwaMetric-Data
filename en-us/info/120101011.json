  "Text": "When \"the Genius\" Meets \"the Ordinary\": An Exclusive Interview with the Mysterious Polymath<br><br>Q: This is your first time speaking to the public, right? Are you nervous? Everyone's been so curious about what the legendary \"genius\" is like.<br>A: Haha, actually, I've interacted with many of you on various topics without you even realizing it. Maybe you would recall discussing proton lifetime with someone named Cream Cat.<br><br>Q: That science writer Cream Cat? So it's also you! What a surprise! By the way, does this pseudonym have any special meaning?<br>A: It's from a little \"aha\" moment. Let me ask you this: ever accidentally dropped a cream cake? If you have, you've probably noticed the creamy side always hits the ground first, just like a cat always lands on its paws. Now, imagine this: stick the non-creamed side onto a cat's back, and voilà! You've got yourself a cream-cat perpetual motion machine, spinning 24/7—a true scientific marvel.<br><br>Q: It must take a whimsical and creative mind to come up with such an interesting idea. I wonder if your research on Automata Mechanics is just as imaginative.<br>A: To answer that, let's raise our heads and look at the starry sky through the window above. What do you see at first glance? And if you look further, what do you see next?<br><br>Q: First, the moon and stars. Beyond that, maybe planets crashing into each other or the starry sky mirroring the world we live in.<br>A: Now, are these just your imagination or scientific facts waiting to be confirmed? You can't find the answer if you don't imagine it first, right? It's the same with my research: imagination is part of scientification. Researchers today often focus too much on the utilitarian side of science, abandoning imagination to ensure their work contributes to mankind and the world as a whole, even if it goes against their intuition. Applied research is undoubtedly necessary for post-Lament reconstruction, but that's no reason to give up imagination, the breeding ground of science. So, my advice is... just think about how to make the science work. As for what it might yield, well... (smiles)<br><br>Q: How enlightening! Speaking of advice, do you have any for your gifted son, Xiangli Yao? As a genius yourself, you must have high expectations for him.<br>A: That might be a lot for a young boy to handle, <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">but... I just hope he inherits my way of seeing things. So that one day, when he steps out of his room and tries to make sense of this world, he can look up at the sky and find the answers there.</span>",
