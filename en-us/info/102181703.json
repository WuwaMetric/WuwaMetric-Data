Anyway, it's a small silver memory unit with my dissertation on it. If found, please contact me! I'm offering ten Canned Surprises as a reward!<br><br>[From \"LahaiRoiTrekkingFanClub\"]<br>…I did find something matching that description while trekking near the Etching Plains. But this is the station's Lost and Found… Are you sure you didn't lose it on the train?<br><br>[From LostMyDataMemory]<br>Ah… the Etching Plains, huh? I actually went there for a survey a few days ago. It might've gotten lost while I was out there.<br><br>[From \"LahaiRoiTrekkingFanClub\"]<br>Got it. Swing by and we'll see if it's yours.",
