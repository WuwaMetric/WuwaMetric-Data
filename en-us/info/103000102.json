Ouch—<br>[00:19] (Sound of collision)<br>[00:20] Oh no, are you okay? Sorry, it's a bit of a mess in here.<br>[00:24] No worries, I'm fine. Just stubbed my toe.<br>[00:30] ...That sounds painful.<br>[00:32] Yeah, it's one of those pains that really hits you when it happens.<br>[00:34] Hahaha! You've got a good sense of humor, haven't you? Wait, what's that look?<br>[00:47] Oh, nothing. I'm just surprised. I didn't expect to see you smile like that.<br>[01:00] Do I come across as stiff to everyone?<br>[01:03] Well, not exactly... But you're always so focused at work, so... Oh, by the way, I heard you're managing this room now. This is the demolition approval form. Could you please sign here? The room's set to be demolished next month to make way for a new office area.<br>[01:36] (A brief silence)<br>[01:47] Ms. Hoda?<br>[01:50] I've signed it, but no one's really managing this room anymore, so you don't need to follow the formal process.<br>[01:58] Well, I heard some of our old employees like to nap here. Just wanted to double-check before construction begins. I didn't expect to find you here... You seem quite familiar with this place?<br>[02:16] Familiar? I don't know if that's the right word. How long have you been with the Black Shores?<br>[02:23] One year and three months.<br>[02:26] Really? Time flies... So, you must have met the Mentor by now?<br>[02:32] Your mentor? You mean the Modulator? Yes, but I've only seen them from a distance. I haven't really had a chance to talk. Big shots like the Modulator and the Shorekeeper are always busy. <br>[02:44] Big shot? You mean my mentor? Ha, sometimes I wonder if things would've been easier for us if they were just a regular member... I actually first ran into them right here. You wanna know the first thing they said to me?<br>[03:01] Really? Umm, I have no idea... <br>[03:06] They asked if I wanted some crispy squab for dinner. <br>[03:11] What?<br>[03:14] Unbelievable, right? It was my first day on the job. Everyone was busy, and I was sitting here, staring at the employee handbook. Almost thought they were one of our cooks. <br>[03:39] So, what happened after that?<br>[03:44] Then Lady Flora, you know, our Mentor's little tail, actually brought some crispy squab over for me. The three of us sat here, ate squab, drank soda, and played cards all night. By the time we said goodbye, I realized all my first-day nerves were gone.<br>[04:20] It wasn't until the next day, during my formal orientation, that I found out they were the Modulator everyone talked about. <br>[04:29] Whoa... That's so cool... I wish it was me...<br>[04:34] I can still vividly picture Mentor with those paper slips stuck to their forehead—his punishment for losing our card game. I remember the vibrant colors of Lady Flora's flowers, the winning hand I had, and the smell of crispy squab. It all happened right here, in this very room.<br>[04:47] And it was just an ordinary day in the Black Shores's most ordinary room.<br>[04:53] ...So, erm, how was the squab?<br>[04:56] Not good. The cook forgot to add seasoning.<br>[05:00] (End of recording)",
