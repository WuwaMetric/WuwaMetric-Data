  "Text": "\"Field Investigation Notes of CSC Ruins - No. 13\"  The mystery of the CSC's disappearance has not been solved by the re-investigation of the site. Documents of the site, transcripts of residents from surrounding areas, and the archives of the Huaxu Academy... All remain very few in quantity even combined. Some remarked that CSC paid the price for their arrogance, and others said that CSC led the way toward the future of mankind.  But what exactly did the most advanced research institute at the time intend to achieve when they left behind these perplexing facilities all across Jinzhou?  (No offense intended! Personally, I believe CSC's behavior of leaving equipment everywhere is not very environmentally friendly. I condemn them only from my personal point of view.)",
