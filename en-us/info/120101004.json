I miss the old days, with him by my side, the both of us together, sharing conversation... Is he as lonely in that other world as I am in this one? Should I go be with him? But I promised that I'd live a long, full life and take care of myself... Oh, Moontree Lodge, I've gotten so old, what do I have to wish for anymore? If you really can pull off miracles as they say, please, tell me. What should I do?<br><br>Heying",
