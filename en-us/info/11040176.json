  "Text": "Who said music must be played by instrument?<br>During my time working in the mine, I kept hearing strange sounds. At first, I thought it was the rumored \"sound\" everyone talked about... But later on, I discovered that these strange sounds actually came from the minerals themselves, and even more astonishingly, they formed a unique tune!<br>The shape the Tacetite is cut into and the quality of the Tacetite both dictates how this tune goes.<br>I sorted through the recordings across the years and arranged them into a song, which is now known as \"Tune of Rocks\".<br>I don't feel quite vigorous lately... But fortunately the Pioneer Association Radio has received the mastertape of \"Tune of Rocks\". My wish has been fulfilled!",
