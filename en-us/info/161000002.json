A bunch of useless ████ left standing. How the hell are we supposed to stop the Kerasaurs?\"<br><br>\"Doesn't matter. If they weren't shorthanded, we'd still be rotting in our ██.\"<br><br>\"We've lived our lives. No regrets if we fall here. But those children… they are Septimont's future. They deserve the chance to grow up.\"<br><br>\"Save the speeches. What do we actually do? Try to get them out? With ██ closing in, there's nowhere safer than here.\"<br><br>\"Then we deal with this the way ████ do. Been a long time since we held weapons. You haven't forgotten how to fight, huh?\"<br><br>\"Heh. Don't go underestimating me! Once I'm done skewering the Kerasaurs, I'll give you a taste of my lance!\"<br><br>\"Your lance? You can't even talk without wheezing, you old bastard!\"<br><br>\"Tch… shut up. So long as I can breathe, I can fight. And while I can fight, those things haven't won yet.\"<br><br>\"Damn right. If we're going down… Maybe next time they talk about us, they'll call us something other than ████...\"",
