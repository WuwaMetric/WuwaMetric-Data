  "Text": "Malfunction Report: In the event of an Echo Train malfunction or abnormal operation, there is a possibility that staff members and visitors without Level 3 clearance may be mistakenly taken to this restricted area.<br> <br>Course of Action: All Echo Trains will undergo recalibration, which is expected to be completed within 32 working days. Prior to this operation, a temporary set of instructions for boarding the Echo Train will be issued through flyers. <br> <br>If any anomalies occur during a ride, efforts will be made to guide passengers to the nearest station, where staff with Level 3 clearance will be on standby to evacuate passengers out of the vault.<br> <br>Although passengers will be unable to enter this area due to insufficient clearance, choosing to disembark here due to rumors about the existence of the \"secret cache\" could lead to unnecessary complications. Therefore, it is essential to direct passengers away from this section.<br> <br>Comment:<br>What do you say we create a story? Spread rumors about ghost trains with no return or mutated trains. This way, if passengers notice something unusual, they'll be more likely to seek our help immediately.<br> <br>Response:<br>Approved. We will include this information in the flyers.",
