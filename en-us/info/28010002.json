  "Text": "To Ms. Eri, or the unknown sender:<br><br>We hope this letter finds you well.<br><br>The details on the application you submitted are for Eri, from our Association. Sadly, she was lost to us decades ago while conducting her membership review fieldwork in Honami. Whether you are Eri herself or a guardian who has completed her work, we extend our profound gratitude. What you have returned to us is beyond value. It has restored a thread of connection we feared was severed forever.<br><br>Regarding the submitted \"Honami City Photo Feature\" and application:<br><br>The photographs speak of a profound love for your subject. They faithfully capture the spirit of the people, the civilization they built, and the unique beauty of their home. Through your lens, we have witnessed not only Honami's vibrant life but also the poignant, brilliant flash it left upon the world at its end.<br><br>After careful deliberation, the editorial board has unanimously approved this late confirmation. Her work will be featured in a special commemorative edition of Wutherium Geographic. It is our honor to formally welcome Eri as a full member of the Pioneer Association. <br><br>The Pioneer Association Headquarters<br>Editorial Board, Wutherium Geographic",
