  "Text": "Greetings, Challenger {PlayerName}.<br><br>The stars of this moment shine for you. Thank you for stepping into Colosseum Olymdos with courage and skill, and for keeping the flames of dueling alive.<br><br>I've been watching you since the moment you defeated your first opponent. Your strategy, focus, and passion, and the thoughts you put into the decks you build... all remind me of the authentic passion I once held for this game.<br><br>Challenger, fight with all your heart! On this battlefield, giving your all is the highest form of respect one duelist can offer another. No matter who will emerge victorious tomorrow, this arena belongs to both of us, two souls fighting for what they love.<br><br>May the dawn bring us to a horizon broader than yesterday's.<br><br>—Conqueror of Prestige, a fellow duelist sharing your passion.",
