  "Text": "Date: [--08]<br>We've reached the final stage of our research, but it seems we've slowed down our progress. Colleagues are leaving one after another. Even Professor Heisen said he's going back to be with his family... He did say that, right? <br>Somehow, I'm not so sure about this. I just vaguely remember he mentioned something like this at some point, but did he actually tell us that? Or did he whisper it in my ears?<br><br>During long, boring nights like this one, this little thing is my only companion. It's hard to believe how much it has grown and changed. Metal parts now adorn its once simple form: steel plates, cogs, clocks, detection devices, blue liquids, white lab coats... and… Is that a diesel generator? Anyway, I can finally see it with my own eyes, without the aid of observation devices.<br><br>Hello? How are you feeling today? You seem surprisingly energetic. But it's no wonder, being trapped your entire life. Longing for freedom, I imagine. <br>Our lab is rarely this quiet. I think no one would notice if I broke the rules a little bit. <br>Ah... I see. So this is how your body feels to the touch. <br>Is that how you laugh? This is the first time I've heard your voice... It sounds familiar, like my colleagues.<br>I can see it... It’s the Gate we've been searching for. <br>Why am I feeling dizzy? My body, it’s so soft now… like water... not my own.<br>My consciousness, floating in the air...<br>Hello everyone… So you've all entered the Gate already…<br>\"Don't cross over,\" you say… What do you mean?<br>No, something's not right... <br>The Miracle we witnessed... This shouldn't be happening...",
