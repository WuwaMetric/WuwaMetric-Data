I intentionally picked them under the guise of seeking treatment for my illness, as you may have noticed. I wish I could go with you, Wuli… I don't have many days left, but I trust you'll find and enjoy the wonders we once dreamed of sharing.<br><br>We've traveled through diverse lands, witnessing lives rebuilding from devastation, and immortalizing extraordinary moments for a wider audience to savor. In this world scarred by the Lament, beauty and hope persist, sprouting anew from the depths of despair. This is our quest, and I hope you will carry this essence with you as your journey unfolds.<br><br>Our adventures have always been shared with companions. We met, journeyed together for a time, and eventually diverged onto separate paths. Perhaps we will reunite on our next escapade, or perhaps destiny will guide us on divergent routes indefinitely. The bravery to explore and forge ahead will forever reside within us.<br><br>This truth holds for our past journey and for the ones ahead for you.<br><br>The day will inevitably come when we must bid each other farewell, just as it will when our paths cross once more. So, my love, please, continue your journey... and carry our joint aspirations into the future.<br><br>With all my love,<br>Fuling",
