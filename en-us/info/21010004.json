  "Title": "The History of Rinascita (Excerpt 1)",
  "Text": "The two great families diverged on the question of whether a formal faith should be established for the Sentinel.<br><br>The Fisalias argued that Rinascita must not retread the fate of the fallen archipelagos and could no longer endure fragmented governance. They advocated for a unifying faith to guide its people, with the Sentinel as the ideal deity. In their view, establishing this faith would also serve as Rinascita's expression of gratitude toward the Sentinel.<br><br>Contrasting sharply with this view, the Abrogati warriors held that the Sentinel was a rare and unrepeatable miracle that could not be summoned at will. To place one's hope in a Divinity whose presence is uncertain, they argued, was both foolish and cowardly. The Sentinel had already demonstrated immense benevolence by guiding the people of Rinascita to new lands. To continue praying for further intervention was inapropriate. Instead, they insisted that people must strive to become warriors worthy of standing alongside such a divine being, facing calamity not through supplication, but through strength.<br><br>The difference between the two forces steep in historical tensions eventually erupted into large-scale conflict. It was only when Tacet Discords attacked Rinascita that both sides realized their new land was far from a place where they could rest easy.<br><br>In the aftermath of the Tacet Discord Crisis and following lengthy negotiations, the Abrogati and their supporters moved westward into the wilds, where they founded Septimont. Meanwhile, the Fisalias led those who remained in establishing what would become Ragunna.",
