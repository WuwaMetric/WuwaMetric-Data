  "Text": "The ancient tree \"Loong's Gaze\", is located in the northern parts of Loong's Gaze Outskirts, Central Plains. Based on records found inside \"Plants of Jinzhou\", the Loong's Gaze is estimated to be between 1400 and 1500 years old, having withstood the test of the Lament and continues to stand tall. Its twisting roots are like a python wrapped around a loong banner, its branches as though piercing claws, both showing the tree's unrestrained nature.<br>This unshakable ancient tree has long since become an icon of the land, as people seek to it as a beacon of hope. As long as the Loong's Gaze stands, the day of the Central Plains' rebirth will sure to come. <br><br>Reminder: Please do not carve on the bark or branches of the tree. We all share an equal responsibility to safekeep the ancient tree's well-being.",
