  "Text": "One of the most powerful families in Ragunna, renowned for their pioneering spirit. The Montelli family played an instrumental role in charting trade routes that not only connect Ragunna, but also greater Rinascita to the wider world. As the city opened its doors, the Montellis rose to prominence, amassing great wealth and unmatched influence.<br><br>The Montelli family also took the lead in introducing and developing Reserved Terminals across Ragunna. While the Order of the Deep dismissed these Terminals as an inferior mockery of the Genesis Nexus and Common Echoes, the Montellis secured the Order's approval to continue their development in secrecy, offering guarantees of safety and hefty tax payment in exchange.<br><br>Unlike the more traditional families, the Montelli family values emotional bonds and shared ideals above bloodlines and social standing. They advocate for the distribution of opportunities and wealth, believing that riches are worth more when they circulate. Though often ridiculed by traditional families as \"nouveau riche with Shell Credits running through their veins,\" the Montellis take no offense—on the contrary, they wear the label with pride.",
