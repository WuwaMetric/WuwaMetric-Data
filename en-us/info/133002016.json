  "Text": "The Fools who survived the dragon's assault—whom the Order refers to as the \"pilgrims\"—drifted on the warm currents, eventually finding refuge in a vast cavern on Penitent's End.<br><br>There, the Fools formed a troupe, determined to one day expose the truth hidden by the Order and return to their home. To achieve this, the troupe wrote numerous plays and \"danced in chains,\" performing tirelessly across the archipelago.<br><br>For years, they have awaited the return of the Carnevale, hoping to expose the Order's secrets through their performance, claim the Laurel, and earn the chance to commune with the Sentinel.",
