  "Text": "To the Moontree Lodge,<br><br>I'm tired. I'm really tired.<br>The many failed experiments and our unachievable goal have filled me with despair.<br>I'm not the right person for the work of the academy, nor am I good at communicating with others. I don't even have what it takes to apologize after hurting the only person who would listen to me.<br>I'm rotten to the core and unworthy of pursuing the truth.<br>Even if I make a wish, I bet no one would want to make my wish come true.<br>But on the off chance... even if there's only a one in ten thousand chance that someone will see this...<br>Please make me disappear from this world. I hope that nobody will remember me and nobody will be sad because of my disappearance.",
