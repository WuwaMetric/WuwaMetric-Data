  "Text": "Talos sent me to the city on errands for the next couple of days, so you're in charge while I'm gone, rookie.<br>Don't sweat it. Just follow my instructions to the letter, and you won't screw this up.<br><br>We open for business after six in the evening. During the day, put those kids on cleaning duty and make sure the broken bottles and mess from the night before are taken care of. No one likes a messy establishment. The Black Alley doesn't get any sunlight, so keep an eye on your watch and don't miss opening time.<br><br>Once people start to come in, hit the green button twice. Start things off with a track to set the mood. And remember: don't serve beverages just yet. If someone decides to make a scene about it, have Vincent take them to the ring and settle it over fists. If Vincent can't handle it, call Talos.<br><br>After a twenty-minute warmup, hit the red button once and the green button twice. Repeat this every half hour. I've prepped some banger music that they'll love. This is when you have the boys bring out the drinks. Once the vibe picks up, that's when the booze starts selling.<br><br>Keep in mind, whenever you see Talos show up, hit the yellow button right away. That'll play her favorite rock song, \"The Black Alley Devils.\"<br><br>That's about it. She's all yours, rookie!",
