  "Text": "The Order of the Deep worships Sentinel Imperator. In Ragunna tradition, the Order's clergy serve as the Sentinel's earthly envoys, entrusted with guiding the people in Their divine word.<br><br>The Order is led by the Primus, and the current Primus, Fenrico, has declared himself the \"Enlightened One,\" the Resonator of the Sentinel. After the last Carnevale, he proclaimed to have discovered the way to commune directly with the Sentinel.<br><br>Beneath the Primus, the Priests oversee the rites and sacred duties of the Order, while the common clergy, known as Acolytes, spend their days poring over the Codex, spreading the Sentinel's teachings throughout Ragunna.<br><br>To uphold divine order, the Order commands three distinct branches:<br><br>Order Tribunal: The Order's secular judicial body that handles civil and criminal matters between families and commoners.<br><br>Chamber of Discipline: The Order's executive arm that commands the military to enforce the law. The Chamber heavily employs Echoes in combat, and its enforcers are often called \"Inquisitors.\"<br><br>Order Penitentiary: The Order's religious court that trials heretics and faithless who question and defy the divine teachings of the Sentinel.",
