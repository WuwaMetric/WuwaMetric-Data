  "Text": "Among that girl's belongings, I came across a recipe. It appears to be for a cake made with a generous amount of starch, sugar, and honey. To call it food feels generous. It's more akin to fuel for a warrior. Such a simple, heavy-handed dish speaks volumes of a culture without nuance.<br>......<br>.........<br>I went ahead and prepared a batch of this so-called Honeycake. Its sweetness, used as the main motif, is overwhelmingly blunt.<br>Even as mere sustenance, I find it difficult to accept something so lacking in even the most basic sense of refinement.<br>Still, the Gondola seemed pleased with the soft texture.<br>......<br>.........<br>I revised the recipe with Redcurrants and a layer of jam. This time, the flavor is at least tolerable.<br>I shared a bit with the Gondola. It rolled happily in the water, heh.<br>......<br>Turns out, it had quietly spat it back out.",
