The primary difference is that Tethys's hardware layer is completely invisible to us, and its software language seems to be from an era beyond our own...<br><br>The entire Tethys System's instruction set, source code, and language are highly restricted and not publicly available. We are unable to perform any code-level maintenance because it autonomously manages all tasks... It's as if it were a natural creation or... it is beyond our understanding.<br><br>...However, my observations have revealed a few intriguing details. While Tethys's code remains tightly guarded, I detect the presence of a stored-program logic architecture - a tried and true computer structure. This design relies on a central processor to access stored data and instructions and carry out computations...<br><br>In other words, the Lament data, which is visualized as stars in Tethys, must flow through a system capable of reading and processing it...<br><br>Similarly, Tethys shares the same bottleneck as traditional stored-program architectures: its efficiency is limited by the central processor's read/write speed. Just as insufficient fuel limits a spacecraft's performance...<br><br>However, it seems Tethys employs another logic structure that integrates the entire central processor physically, allowing it to handle all instructions and data simultaneously. This necessitates a processor of unimaginable power, one capable of managing the data throughput of something as massive as the Black Shores... Why would Tethys incorporate such a complex logic structure?<br><br>...There are too many mysteries and no answers. I can only document what I've discovered, but beyond that, I am powerless...",
