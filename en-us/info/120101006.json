I could only eat one bowl of rice for lunch in the past, but now I can finish two large bowls! Also, I used to have to step on a small bench to touch the branches of Grandpa Tree, but now I only need to jump casually to touch them!<br>I feel like something amazing is burning inside my body. Is this what it feels like to become a great hero? I've been waiting for ages now. I wonder when I'll be able to use amazing powers like Blaze Ranger...<br>Moontree Lodge, oh Moontree Lodge, the adults all say that you can make any wish come true... Can you help me become a great hero?<br><br>Mahn",
