Archid entrusted me with the tower's master key and his Blake Bloom before he died.\" <br>\"…What happened to him?\"<br>\"A TD Outbreak. He saved the people of a village, but didn't have time to save himself. I was all too late.\"<br>\"On behalf of the Black Shores, I offer our deepest respect and condolences to this Consultant.\"<br>\"The Black Shores… Archid spoke of you people often. I'd like to take his place, to keep watch over this observation tower in his stead.\"<br>\"May I have your name?\"<br>\"Flavio. From Septimont. Once a Gladiator of the Colosseum.\"<br>\"You wish to take on his duties?\"<br>\"I witnessed Archid's final moment—he passed in glory, without a regret. If I stay here, might I one day come to understand this glory?\"<br>\"…We cannot promise that. The Black Shores does not advocate action plans premised on sacrifices.\"<br>\"I don't care.\"<br>\"…Sir?\"<br>\"I'll stay here. For someone like me, a Gladiator who's lost everything, a glorious death is the best I could ask for.\"",
