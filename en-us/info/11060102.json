  "Text": "The battle for 91.7 Heights lasted 11 days and nights, and our platoon, including the platoon leader and platoon deputy, lost 16 men, 7 were seriously wounded, and 8 were lightly wounded. The battle was as follows:<br>In late October, the enemy attacked my 91.7 unnamed heights, after several days and nights of repeated struggle, the enemy has encroached on most of the surface positions. 27 October, my department was ordered to put into battle to support friendly neighboring forces.<br>Under cover of fire, our unit launched six attacks on the enemy within eight hours, all of which failed to accomplish the task of expelling the enemy from the heights completely.<br>At dawn on the 28th, the enemy unsuccessfully launched a counter-attack with fire support.<br>From October 28 to November 6, control of the surface position changed hands several times, and neither side made a breakthrough.<br>On the night of the 6th, our department was replaced by friendly neighboring forces and withdrawn from the battlefield for repairs due to large losses and more than 70% casualties.<br>Lesson Learned:<br>The casualties of our section came mainly from kills by enemy close-range direct fire. This came to prove that the defensive experience promoted in the Army concerning indirect fire was effective; on the other hand, it proved that we were ill-prepared for close-range fighting, a detailed summary of the lessons learned is attached.",
