  "Text": "Years ago, there were two close friends who lived on Mt. Firmament. One of them loved stories about the world and wanted to travel around the world, collecting stories while adventuring like the protagonists of stories. When the Sentinel was about to seal Mt. Firmament, this person left Mt. Firmament on horseback.<br>The other person loved the sounds of the mountain, such as the gurgling water and chirping birds. She hung windchimers everywhere in the mountains and played the guqin on the mountain every day because she wanted to hear the music of the mountains and valleys.<br>They made a promise to reunite here after a few decades. At their reunion, one would tell stories of the world, and the other would play the beautiful music of the mountains and forests.<br>However, time flowed differently on Mt. Firmament, and one day there was equivalent to a few decades outside. Time passed mercilessly. The one who left could no longer return home, and the one who stayed could only watch as her guqin decayed.<br>In this vast expanse, every goodbye could be a farewell for life.<br>Be well. Farewell.",
