  "Text": "Operation number: D12547<br>Action Team: \"Gray Eagle\"<br>Time of Operation: □□□□□□□□<br>Target: Feilian Beringal<br><br>The following is my action diary:<br><br>Just after arriving at the large east-facing Gate in Dim Forest at midday, the entire party was ambushed. We were attacked by deranged Hoochiefs that squealed and bit into our compatriots, and I heard screams from all sides. Fearing that bullets might accidentally injure our companions, we all resisted with only daggers and other weapons.<br>The regimental commander ordered the troops to split into three groups for temporary shelter, and I was placed in the group the commander was in. It was late at night when we arrived at the originally intended battle point, and we were all exhausted, yet no one was able to sleep. Soon we heard the cries of the Hoochief again from outside, these guys were endless and the soldiers had run out of ammunition. Having lost the means of resistance, the chief ordered the cave to be closed off using bombs, however the Hoochiefs still rushed in before the bombs exploded, and when the chief died with the last Hoochief, the bombs also got detonated and the cave was sealed off completely.<br>The signal with Huanglong was cut off and we couldn't contact the rest of the team. Trapped in the cave, we were gradually weakening, when I found a hidden hard disk in a collapsed hole next to us. Upon parsing it, I realized that it was actually information left over from the wartime institute's research, which recorded information about a laboratory hidden in Huanglong. I would also like to request that whoever finds this diary go there to prevent something like today from happening again.<br><br>&&&& (12587, 46899)",
