  "Text": "Today, Master Dollmaker told me stories about Mommy and Daddy again. He said they were brave Patrollers who were betrayed by some really bad people. <br><br>Master Dollmaker only seems to get happy when he talks about this. He promised me that he'd bring them back to me, and when that happens, they'll get their revenge. <br><br>I do miss Mommy and Daddy, but I don't remember much about them. Do they want to become puppets? And get revenge? I don’t know. But if they came back, we'd be happy every day. Right?",
