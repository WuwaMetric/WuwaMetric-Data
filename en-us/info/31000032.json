  "Text": "Entry No. 14<br>1. Status of suppression device: Reactivated. Functions, normal. Rate of fog suppression continues to decline.<br>2. Data analysis and additional notes: Recent suppression results, unsatisfactory. Assuming the effectiveness of the suppression device remains constant, I can only infer that the increase of energy intensity within the fog's source is present.<br>Test results have revealed that the fog carries energy of similar frequency, as detected in the mud-like substance found within the marsh. I can confirm with high confidence that these phenomena are derived from a unique and unified source in this area.<br>In addition, it has been observed that <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">the Mourning Aix performed repeated entries into the fog carrying reactants of high energy intensity</span>. Followed by <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">a plummet in the efficiency of the suppression device</span> after its departure. I believe that Mourning Aix correlates with the source.<br>However, I am puzzled to find that <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">the Mourning Aix's vital signs</span> weakened each time it departed from the fog. Lacking data... Further observations needed.<br>Recorder: Shi'er, SR-461",
