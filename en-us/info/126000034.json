  "Text": "1. Wow, just tried Morri Cow's milk and it's unlike anything I've tasted before! It has a unique blend of spiciness, numbing sensation, and grassy bitterness, making it a perfect substitute for Salted Milk Tea. I have a feeling this will be a crowd-pleaser. If you're interested in trying the Salted Milk Tea, leave a comment so we can organize a sampling event in Jinzhou and potentially bring it to mass production.<br>2. I'm already craving more of this delicious milk!<br>3. Hot & Spicy Milk Tea is my new addiction, can't live without it.<br>4. Count us in for the tasting event, our whole family wants to order some!",
