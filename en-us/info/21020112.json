They appear to be part of an unfinished novel or essay.)<br> <br>...Ziegler was stranded on his private island, with only a coconut tree for company and the occasional Bell Crab scuttling across the beach.<br> <br>Who was he? Ziegler Senior's son? Ragunna's most successful investor? The poor soul who lost everything in a gamble, with all his wealth and titles now gone? A mad artist? A hermit? The unfortunate fool who got caught in a shipwreck?<br> <br>He gazed at the sea, the soft breeze lifting his graying hair while stirring the waves. In the golden glint of sunlight, he seemed to see countless versions of himself scattered through time, broken and incomplete. He felt a loneliness like never before, yet a strange sense of satisfaction.<br> <br>He had no chance of leaving this island. Maybe tomorrow, or the day after, he would breathe his last breath under the scorching sun.<br> <br>He had exhausted all of his miracles. The thought crossed his mind but quickly vanished without a trace. He decided to take some time to observe his island—to engrave all of its details deep into his mind, to fill his fragmented memories with them, and to hope that the coming darkness would not turn them to nothingness.<br> <br>(The writing ends here.)",
