  "Text": "When we speak about the concept of \"love\", we often analyze it from a psychological perspective and conclude it is an emotional motivation. When analyzed from a biological perspective, it is due to the secretion of hormones. However, all are conducted from the perspective of human beings themselves, without any exception. The love between animals or other creatures, on the other hand, seems to be less complex and sophisticated, and more inclined to biological instinct, reproduction, companionship, and courtship, as they do not possess any form of human intelligence.<br>Now, what of those two Tacet Discords? As entities that carry information and embody energy, are they forbidden to garner the instinct to \"love\"? Do they sing and cry as the information they carry is love mimicked from humans? Or is it due to the self-consciousness that prompts such actions on their own from a certain cause?<br>We have no way of knowing for certain. But as you have found out yourself, the question returns to its roots: What is the true meaning of \"love\"?<br>From a researcher's point of view, I would perhaps say that \"love\" itself is merely unique information in the form of energy. An afterglow of the Big Bang. And we are all just carriers who are fortunate enough to carry it. It is just that different carriers produce varying interpretations, and the difference between us and the creatures in love lies precisely in ourselves.<br>Thus I will not be left in sorrow due to farewell, as I was able to convey this information owing to our meeting.<br>You have materialized the love inside my body, transforming me into a much-perfected individual.",
