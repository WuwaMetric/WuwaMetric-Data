Still thinking about the prophecy Grandmother Lillibet mentioned yesterday, I guess… On the bright side, I won't be late for morning oration!<br><br>8:00 Morning<br>Breakfast was milk, fruit, and herb bread. I'm still not used to eating on a fixed schedule, but the senior Priestesses say discipline makes a proper Priestess.<br><br>12:00 Noon<br>Classes are over. I think I managed to see a little farther today. We all went for lunch together. Bland as ever. Nothing worth writing about.<br><br>2:00 Afternoon<br>The Senate sent someone to speak with Grandmother Lillibet. Something about the prophecy of Septimont and the Hero of Heroes… I didn't catch the rest. Will I be able to have visions like that?<br><br>5:00 Dusk<br>I wish I could go outside and play. Or just go home. But everyone else is so focused… Sister Sophia carved an entire wall today. She's amazing.<br><br>7:00 Evening<br>Went for a little stroll after dinner. Saw a few stars!<br><br>11:00 Late Night<br>Time for bed, though I'm not sleepy at all. Sometimes following the schedule feels like a chore. But today was... not bad, I guess.",
