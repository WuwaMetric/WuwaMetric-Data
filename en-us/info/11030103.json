The Future train set was used to transport the elite group of the then ■■■ City out of the worst affected areas, and due to the limited number of people it could carry, a large number of civilians were stranded in the waiting area and a large-scale conflict broke out. The train's famous pianist, ■■■, decided to get off the train in solidarity with the other civilians, and began playing on the spot in the VIP waiting area. The sound of his piano calmed the crowd and echoed the cries of the people. After the train was sealed off at Gate, the system's voice announcement \"■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■\" once again enraged the crowd, and their rushing caused the train to derail and crash into a mountain, causing an even larger landslide, leaving no survivors.",
