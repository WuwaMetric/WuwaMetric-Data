  "Text": "Impossible. Blessed by \"Divinity\"? I refuse to believe it. <br> <br>It is we who conquer the sea, not it! When storms tear the mast apart, and rocks smash the keel, where is Divinity's voice then? When we haul ropes and tighten sails, where is Divinity's guidance? We conquer it. It does not bless us!<br> <br>No, I will never yield. No god, no matter which one, can ever fulfill my revenge, <span class=\"italic\">our</span> revenge and fate! Do not be cowered, do not be deceived! What others promise us means nothing. Only what we seize from the merciless sea matters! Prayers and blessings will not calm these waters, it is we who are the masters of this sea!<br> <br>Never stop! Even if it summons the entire ocean to fight against us, we must still complete our conquest! We must prove, beyond a doubt, that we are the true masters of this sea!<br> <br>Hoist the sails, ready the spears, and tighten the winches, lads!<br> <br>To the whirlpool! This tempest is the great wave pushing us forward, and this fierce wind only feeds our flames!<br> <br>Do not stop! Sail into the storm! Even if it means we must dive into the dark whirlpool and the abyss!",
