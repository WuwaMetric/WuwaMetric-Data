  "Text": "It was the fifth day into the field and I finally had time to write something down.<br>I was assigned to be the platoon clerk, a platoon of 30 men. I had to write down what I ate, drank and slept, what I took and what I did. Geiger counters were going off every day, and shells flew by from time to time in the near distance.<br>I don't know if I was lucky or not, but an enemy bomb hit the bunker I had dug. It burned my Backpack to a pile of ashes. Fortunately, I was passing orders and dodged a bullet. But in the late fall, without a sleeping bag and a change of clothes, and not knowing how to survive the coming winter.<br>The platoon sergeant in charge of logistics, a warm-hearted man, let me have his brand new sleeping bag and clothes, and went to use the already moldy spares himself. I only took the sleeping bag, promising to return it to him when the rations were issued. He didn't answer or take back his clothes, just smiled and left. The night was too cold and I didn't want to go after him. Might as well wait until tomorrow to give it back to him.",
