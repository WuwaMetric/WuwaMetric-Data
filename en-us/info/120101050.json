Moss had started growing beneath the glass. This city, fractured and folded in on itself, seems trapped in some kind of temporal loop. Time moves forward and backward within a fixed range. But oddly enough, the plants don't seem bound by each \"reset.\"<br><br>The moss shouldn't be able to grow between the gears... unless time isn't flowing normally here. It's eroding, rushing, and spawning things that shouldn't even exist in the first place.<br><br>Still, I'm grateful for this strange, unreasonable growth. It made me realize this city isn't beyond saving. There is a way out.<br><br><span class=\"italic\">(The pen seems to pause, leaving a small blot of ink on the paper.)</span><br><br>There's one thing I still can't let go of. <br><br>That rift... In my blurred memory, it sealed shut almost as soon as I was pulled into the storm. But if I can't figure out what caused it, or how to stop it. There's no way to guarantee it won't open again. And if it does... someone else could get dragged in.<br><br>However, time's against me.",
