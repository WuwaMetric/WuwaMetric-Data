  "Text": "Dear Annis,<br><br>The Trials are tomorrow! I'm so nervous… but a tiny bit excited too.<br><br>The Fisalias are really, really scary… Some of them strut around all high and mighty, while others are just… unsettling, like something out of a bad dream.<br><br>They must be really good at handling poisons, right? Just the thought of facing them makes me uneasy.…<br><br>I overheard that unsettling Fisalia girl whispering that poison can be medicine too. She said with just the right amount, it won't hurt anyone but actually save them.<br><br>Perhaps even if I don't pass the Trials, I could pick up some of their secrets about poisons and figure out the ingredients. Then maybe, just maybe, I could make something to help Jojo.<br><br>Thinking about it that way makes things a little less scary. For Jojo's sake, what's a little poison, anyway!<br><br>Be careful tomorrow, my dear Annis. We don't have Fisalia blood, and they know a lot more about poisons than we do.<br><br>Yours,<br>Chloe",
