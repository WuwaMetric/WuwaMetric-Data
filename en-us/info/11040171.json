  "Text": "Tan: Are you really working the night shift at the mine?<br>Jing: I decided to find myself a means of livelihood before the water and food run out at home. Saves me from starving myself.<br>Jing: It wasn't as terrible as I had imagined, though. I kept staring at the \"grand elevator\" on that side, trying to kill time. It must have gone up and down at least fifty times this evening.<br>Tan: Isn't it too frequent?<br>Tan: Moreover, I heard that the mine has recently reduced the night shifts. So why is there still so much activity?<br>Jing: I don't know either. Let me check with my night-security-adapted Forte.<br>Jing: Something's definitely wrong...<br>Tan: What is it?<br>Jing: Nobody's in the elevator. I checked the platforms across the levels. No one's waiting... I have to go and check for myself.<br>Tan: Hey hey hey. Don't get ahead of yourself yet. If this was a movie, the thing waiting for you out there definitely would not be what you expected.<br>Jing: That's not true. I have to take care of more than my own safety, now that I'm in this job. Besides, you should start to be rational. Didn't you brag about being the new generation of Jinzhou? Why do you believe in this kind of thing more than those squares?<br>Jing: Maybe it's just mechanical malfunctioning, or my co-workers being naughty? The work here is so dull. Maybe they decided to \"surprise\" me a little?<br>Tan: Sentinel bless you. Good luck, then.",
