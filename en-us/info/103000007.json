What is that?<br>\"It's a special feeling, when memories of the past manifest in your mind. Or should I call it... a feeling of nostalgia?\"<br>I can show you whatever you wish to see with a Sonoro Sphere.<br>\"That's not quite what I meant...\"<br>Is that a smile on your face, or... the so-called \"bitterness\"?<br>...<br>\"Well... I built it from my memories. I believe it should work.\"<br>A piano? <br>\"It links the Tethys System with the stars, allowing you to control it through sound.\"<br>Control stars with sound? <br>\"Yes, why not give it a try?\"<br>...<br>\"...Many have perished.\" <br>Sacrifice is inevitable when the Lament strikes. <br>\"What are we truly fighting for? The Lament never ends. What is the purpose...\" <br>You can rely on me and everyone here. <br>You're not alone in this. <br>When was the last time you took a break? You need to rest.<br>\"I'm sorry... I can't show weakness in front of them...\"<br>Put more trust in our companions. Their faith in our shared goal won't be shaken that easily.<br>\"Thank you... I'm just thinking...\"<br>\"If everything is already predetermined, then when we want to change the course of history...\" <br>\"There's only one way.\"",
