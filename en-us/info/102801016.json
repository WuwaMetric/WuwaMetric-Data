  "Text": "Title: Spectrum Anomaly Monitoring Report for Subject C-001<br><br>Entry: #H-C-6947<br><br>Abstract:<br><br>The data presented in this report were obtained from spectrum evaluations performed on Subject C-001, also known as \"Jué,\" from June ████ to December ████.<br><br>During a preliminary experiment conducted on June 14th, ████ researchers observed a 15-second frequency loss in Subject C-001's spectrum. Five additional tests were later conducted through the following day, and all data obtained reflecting the frequency loss were highly consistent (Margin of error averaged below 0.02).<br><br>The recorded data of the Resonance Spectrum on the 3rd, 6th, 11th, 23rd, and 30th of the subsequent month indicated a gradual lengthening of Subject C-001's frequency loss. The data exhibited significant increases with varying patterns. It was postulated that this event occurred due to the presence of Subject C-002, also known as the \"Mianloong Chamber.\" Subsequent thirty-two one-factor experiments confirmed a significant correlation between Subject C-002 and the duration of frequency loss in Subject C-001. Notably, Subject C-002 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the duration growth of Subject C-001.<br><br>Based on spectrum monitoring data of Subject C-001 from June ████ to December ████, the following preliminary conclusions can be drawn:<br><br>1. Subject C-001 bears defect/malfunction.<br>2. Subject C-002 can temporarily slow down the escalation of Subject C-001's defect, but cannot make up for Subject C-001's frequency loss.<br><br>Appendix-1 (Source: Research Memo #C349)<br><br>With the help of the \"peculiar visitor\", we were given the opportunity to converse with Subject C-001 directly. It was a meaningful and mutual conversation, though we didn't get as much information as I had hoped for.<br><br>But at the very least, the conversation proved one point: Our previous research was effective, and there was no defect in C-001. As per C-001's own declaration, \"One of the Temporal Programs was lost,\" and during its prime, C-001 had the capability to manipulate time by decelerating or even halting it, rewinding it, and making corrections as needed. Nonetheless, the current condition of C-001 can be described as one of sickness, with irreversible disruptions to time rendering any attempts at correction or restoration ineffective. Consequently, Mt. Firmament has been transformed into an isolated entity amidst the vast oceans of time, despite the initial purpose being one of redemption.<br><br>Appendix-2 (Source: Research Memo #C382)<br><br>By running through time flow models, we came up with two hypotheses:<br><br>Hypothesis #1: C-001's \"defect\" is none congenital, and this \"defect\" may have taken place around the period of C-001's first arrival at Mt. Firmament (it has been confirmed that the \"defect\" cannot be reversed, see report #H-C-7426).<br><br>Hypothesis #2: The discrepancy in temporal progression between the interior and exterior of the \"time bubble\" has been progressively widening. Based on data comparisons, there exists a correlation between the deceleration rate of time flow in Mt. Firmament and the growth rate of the duration of C-001's frequency loss.<br><br>Expanding on the second hypothesis... If C-001 were to eventually cease to exist, the uncontrolled flow of time in Mt. Firmament would likely surpass its limitations and impact a broader range of regions… Such as, the entirety of Jinzhou.<br><br>…This might be why that \"peculiar visitor\" offered to work with us in the first place…<br><br>Appendix-3 (Source: Research Memo #C457)<br><br>Efforts are being made to advance the development of the artificial Resonance Object. Although we have not yet achieved success, we have decided to name it the \"Chronosorter\" in honor of our recent progress.<br><br>I know we have our \"peculiar visitor\" to thank for every progress we've made so far. If the \"Chronosorter\" project is successful, it's a win-win for everyone involved. As I had anticipated, they intend to restore and utilize C-001's complete power in order to rectify the temporal distortion, with the aid of a Resonance Object.<br><br>There is still a significant journey ahead of us. This is merely the starting point.",
