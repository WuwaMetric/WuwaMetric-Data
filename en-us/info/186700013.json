With the Sentinel's guidance, the Order of the Deep swiftly gained control of the Common Echoes and used them to guide Their people...<br><br>...The first serious shortage of Common Echoes emerged, accompanied by a rise in smuggling and private purchases of Echoes among the city's nobility. There is an immediate need to upgrade the frequency-cutting technology to reduce the time needed to cut and merge different TD frequencies, ultimately establishing a mass-production line for creating Echoes of diverse forms and abilities...<br><br>...The Order of the Deep has obtained direct control of long-range aggregation technology.

This marks a breakthrough in the spatial and temporal limitations of Common Echoes, as well as a significant improvement in their stability...<br><br>...As opposition grew, the Order developed a new kind of Echo: La Guardia. They served as the watchful eyes and forceful hands of the Order, and their creation helped restore public trust in the ordinary Common Echoes...<br><br>...The experiments on implanting and shaping the consciousness of the Echoes in the Fabricatorium have shown progress.
