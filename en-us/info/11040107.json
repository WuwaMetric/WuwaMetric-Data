  "Text": "Xiao Gui's baby was born, at night. The moonlight shone in through the big hole that had been blown up, and it was quite bright. We all chatted about naming the baby, and finally chose \"Changming\". The child cried at the sound of the name, and then Xiao Gui followed suit, and so did everyone else, even Sanshui, who wiped his eyes.<br>Before the roof of the cave was blown open, there was no light from the sky. Listening to the cannon fire outside, in addition to fear, there is also a bit of unspeakable ...... ease. Now it was better to always know when it was light and dark and when it was raining. Everyone has decided to live here, Threnodian how it will be in the end, I do not intend to think about it, here is quite good.<br><br>Maybe, in the future, someone will come here to investigate and find \"cavemen\" or something. I'm just writing this down in the hope that the explorer doesn't embarrass us by treating us like ancient apes, with all the research and studies.<br>We are just villagers who came here for refuge, nothing special, no need to remember us.",
