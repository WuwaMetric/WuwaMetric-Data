  "Text": "My dear boy,<br> <br>Leaving you is the last thing I want, but these troubled times force my hand. All I can offer now are a few words on this torn paper.<br><br>Stand tall and live your life with pride. Your parents gave their lives for the dignity of art, and you carry the same blood in your veins.<br><br>I've sacrificed my freedom in pursuit of the endless mysteries these Echoes hold, but I believe in you—you have a strong heart. Hold on to hope and keep moving forward.<br><br>One day, the treasure we have valued deep within the Averardo Vault will bring forth new hope.<br><br>With Love,<br>Ash",
