  "Text": "NO. SY-A038<br>Date: [---]<br><br>Subject A038 has been assigned to a 6m x 6m x 6m artificial controllable Tacet Field. Regular environmental checks must be conducted every 6 hours for the artificial Tacet Field.<br>Entry into the designated area is strictly limited to experiment personnel and any devices or tools that do not meet standard specifications are forbidden to prevent interference with the subject.<br><br>Preliminary observations indicate that Subject A038, who was born in the artificial Tacet Field, is able to survive stably.<br>However, it is worth noting that the subject has yet to exhibit any specific physical features or vocal behaviors. It appears to lack a physical form and can only be observed through specialized means.<br>At present, A038 shows no discernible behavioral objectives and remains mostly stationary with low levels of aggression and activity.<br>Due to significant deviations from our initial expectations, further research is required to gain a deeper understanding of the subject.<br>Note: High sensitivity to frequency has been observed. Strict control of standard frequency specifications within the experimental area is imperative.<br>Given the unique nature of A038, additional time is necessary to establish appropriate parameters and data language in order to gain valuable insights into its information. This process will require a considerable amount of time given our current technology and available data.<br><br>WARNING: Any leakage of experimental information through any means is strictly prohibited. Taking photos or recordings of the subject without express permission from Professor Heisen is strictly forbidden.<br>This concludes the initial observations recorded for Subject A038. To obtain more comprehensive information on the subject, future experiments and analyses are crucial.",
