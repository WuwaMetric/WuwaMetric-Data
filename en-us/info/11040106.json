When the first sound was heard, the new bed that had just been built on Xiao Gui's side was shaken to the point that it all fell apart, and the sand and dust fell from the cracks in the stone above his head, and he was immediately dumbfounded, and he didn't move. Until the second sound, he howled violently again.<br>Sansui told him to shut up, but he still howled, so Sansui gave him a slap on the face and told him not to affect everyone.<br>It didn't matter to me. By the time the first sound came, I was already thinking about my next life. In my next life I want to be a Gulpuff, zapping whoever gets me, not hiding in this dank cave.<br><br>Day 110.<br>Sansui says Threnodian can stomp hundreds of Gulpuffs with one foot, I say it doesn't matter, Gulpuff will zap his foot.<br>Not much rattling today.",
