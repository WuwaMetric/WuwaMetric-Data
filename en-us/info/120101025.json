  "Text": "More researchers have left... No one's going to continue the research on the Tacet Field.<br>It feels like everything we've been studying is akin to planting a seed in a Petri dish out in the Tacet Field. And guess what? That seed might germinate, dissolve into the culture solution, or even mutate into a monster and burst out.<br>Our research is just as chaotic. Experimental data that should remain constant at 3.74 can suddenly skyrocket to 7.65 the next moment. Is this the truth we've been pursuing? How bitterly ironic!<br>I would feel somewhat relieved if such an impossible error was due to my own incompetence. But if the Lament has already overturned the very order of this world, what's the point of scientific inquiry?",
