  "Text": "Hahaha! Bravo! Let us sing another to this occasion! With Ragunna City behind us, at long last we've arrived where the knights once set camp.<br><br>Oh, those marvelous knights living the way of Korlacchi—!<br><br>We build bonfires at night and admire the windmills during the day. We play music and sing together under their turning sails. The townsfolk call us \"bonfire bards.\"<br><br>When the windmills come to rest, we'd go chasing along the rivers and lakes. But above all these, there's nothing like flying across the field on a clear day.<br><br>From the air, I glance down at this land wrinkled by time. Sunlight blankets over the pillars of the knight's collapsed ruins, where a thousand-year-old tree stands in its silent vigil, with its roots sprawling across the stone crevices. As the wind carries me across the lake's surface, the reflections of the red roof tiles of the Egla Town gleam and dance like pomegranate seeds scattered on top of a sheet of blue silk. The red-topped windmill overlooks the town, slowly turning and beckoning homebound travelers.",
