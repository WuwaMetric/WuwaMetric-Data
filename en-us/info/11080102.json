  "Text": "Guided by Starflower and the whispering plants, I stumbled upon a magnificent purple-branched arborvitae. The shape of its leaves resembled that of the Ficus genus, but the source of its striking color remains a mystery.<br>As I approached the tree, a group of fiercely protective female orangutans coiled beneath it, their eyes gleaming with ferocity. To avoid a confrontation, I spent several days collecting their shed hair and fashioned it into a makeshift tunic. With this disguise, I was able to get close enough to collect samples of the leaves.<br>Unfortunately, due to the season, I was unable to obtain samples of the flowers or fruits, and there were no pollinating insects in sight. This species still holds many secrets waiting to be unveiled.<br>I've tentatively named it Ficus purpurea and promised to return when the time is right. Farewell for now, my dear Ficus purpurea. Until we meet again and uncover your century-old tale.",
