Despite extensive study, our understanding remains incomplete due to a lack of information on their composition. <br>As time passes, this gap in knowledge will only widen, resulting in the gradual decay and eventual annihilation of these discords. To sustain itself, the Tacet Discords possess an instinctual drive to consume and merge with other frequencies, in a constant battle to maintain its existence.<br><br>[Appendix: Echoes] <br>Upon its demise, the frequencies of a Tacet Discord will not immediately vanish. Instead, they will slowly decay over time, allowing for their capture and utilization. <br>Once enough frequencies have been stored, they can be harnessed to replicate the abilities of the original Tacet Discord. <br>This remaining energy, capable of emulating the defeated entity's power, is known as an Echo — a valuable asset that must be carefully collected and preserved in our laboratory archives.",
