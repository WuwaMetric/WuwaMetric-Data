  "Text": "Date: [--02]<br>The C.V. laboratory is located in an abandoned site within Whining Aix's Mire. The main structure was built using a special material developed by C.V., which prevented severe weathering and corrosion. As a result, the building remained relatively intact. After a risk assessment, the research committee decided to use the base level of the site for an artificial Tacet Field.<br>A few mechanical instrument abandoned by C.V. are left at the experiment environment. Outside the environment, a low-frequency lighting system was installed at a regulated distance and angle, ensuring permanent illumination of the experiment area.<br>The experimental environment center is composed of multiple bundled cables that secure a spherical metal device. The cables transmit the input and output data from within the metal device. Surrounding the spherical device are frequency detection instruments of the same specifications. These instruments are typically controlled by dials. When the dial is rotated clockwise, the electrical energy will drive the composite metal frame to rotate in a high angular speed clockwise around the central device for synchronizd frequency detection.",
