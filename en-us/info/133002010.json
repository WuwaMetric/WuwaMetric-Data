  "Text": "In Rinascita, most Echoes can exist independently from Reserved Terminals within the radius of the Genesis Nexus. They are known as Common Echoes.<br><br>In Ragunna, the Order of the Deep governs the allocation and use of these Echoes. The people of Ragunna revere them as divine gifts, even as envoys of Sentinel Imperator. They treat them as friends and trusted allies, incorporating them into every aspect of daily life. This deep, symbiotic bond with Common Echoes is what has earned Rinascita its name as the \"Land of Echoes.\"",
