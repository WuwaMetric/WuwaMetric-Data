  "Text": "On Border Mountains, amidst the remains of a fallen dragon, a battle between man and dragon started.<br><br>The Gladiator held his breath, sword pointed skyward, like a living statue. The air trembled with a thunderous roar as brilliant wings unfurled, casting the land in shadow. One would descend, and one will rise to meet it. Only one would claim the victory.<br><br>As the sun bled across the mountains, the dragon finally lowered its head in defeat, surrendering to the man who tamed the wilderness.<br><br>That day, another hero was born upon the trial grounds.",
