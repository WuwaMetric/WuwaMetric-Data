  "Text": "The bastard and that lapdog of hers are still on my tail. But this is as far as I can go for now. I need to rest. My right hand hurts so much I think it might be broken. As for my mind... I still feel dazed, but already much clearer than before. I thought I was losing it... I need to sit here for a while. Here's hoping those traps can buy me some time...<br><br>Soon I'll be able to see the sun, see the moon... the skies. Sometimes I forget I once belonged there, a place with sunlight and order. And here? Even the air reeks with despair... By Imperator, may this cursed dump and all its evil slowly rot in these dark sewers.<br><br>I couldn't find Brandon, but I have a feeling he was here—I can't tell if it's a hunch or if I'm being delusional. He must've made it out already... Yeah, that's right. The fellow's got more tricks up his sleeves than I do. He must've dropped his ID card in those vents as a distraction. Even got me fooled. Just like when we played pool... And here I am worrying about him. Ha, I'm such an idiot.<br><br>It's fine, I'll be out soon enough. Brandon, when I find you... I'm going to give you a good punch in the face. Just you wait.",
