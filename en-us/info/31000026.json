But before that, everyone was already been taking care of me and shared with me delicious meals. My father told me I'm a child of the Qichi Village, and I should consider myself lucky. I feel really fortunate to be loved by so many people. Even though my powers are still small, I'll do my best to continue protecting the village from being invaded by Tacet Discords!",
