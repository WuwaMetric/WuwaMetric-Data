Continue along the Hero’s Way, an ancient path once trodden by Gladiators on pilgrimage to the legendary Colosseum Olymdos. Frequencies of their emotions still linger along the route, guiding travelers toward the majestic city on top of Capitoline Hill, where the awe-inspiring Gryphon’s Fortress stands.<br>...<br>Begin your day with a visit to Colosseum Olymdos to witness a live gladiatorial match (check the event schedule in advance and pick your favorite showdown). Explore the public rest areas of top Gladiators for a glimpse behind the scenes. Next, make your way to the Vale of Glory, where stone-carved weapons commemorate the legendary heroes and Gladiators of Septimont, whose names still echo through the ages.<br>...<br>Hop on the Cable Car and glide down to the bustling Caracalla Market, where you can sip the signature blends at Solis, browse arms and armor at the Silver Helmet Store, and pick up unique mementos at the Pygmalion Workshop. Cap off your journey with a relaxing soak at the Thermes Baths, where warm waters soothe away the weariness of your adventure.<br>...<br>This guide is for reference only. Feel free to plan your day according to your own pace. The best itinerary is always the one that suits you. May your time in Septimont be unforgettable!",
