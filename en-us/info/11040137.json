  "Text": "Hardness: 6<br>Density: 3.0-3.5 g/cm?<br>Compressive Strength: 3000-5000 kg/cm?<br><br>The specimen is named Moire Stone, characterized by its fine structure, high hardness, and strong compressive strength. It exhibits excellent chemical stability and can withstand extreme temperature variations.<br>Moire Stones are widely distributed in the Gorges of Spirits, forming large-scale deposits that faciliate easy mining. Sizable blocks can be easily mined. All these factors make Moire Stones excellent construction materials suitable for large-scale sculptures, exterior walls of buildings, and hard paving.<br><br><span class=\"italic\">Note: It is used in the construction of Jinzhou and the creation of the Sentinel sculpture.</span>",
