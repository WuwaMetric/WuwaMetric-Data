  "Title": "The Tethys System",
  "Text": "Also known as the Civilization Simulation Sand Table, the Tethys System is a supercomputer unique to the Black Shores. By inputting Lament frequency data—collected both manually and via beacon access—into the system, the Black Shores can issue Lament warnings for locations worldwide within a 24 to 48-hour time range. This capability is the cornerstone of the Black Shores' extensive collaborations with countries across the globe.<br><br>The results generated by the Tethys System are projected as a starry sky within the underground of the Black Shores, made possible by multiple Anchors and underground Data Hubs. This has earned the underground region the title \"City of Eternal Night\".<br><br>The Tethys System has no discernible energy source, physical infrastructure, or processing core. Its coding language is extremely complex, and it is only known that its terminals take the form of various autonomous robots. In essence, the Tethys System is almost akin to a natural phenomenon, with an origin that remains entirely mysterious.",
