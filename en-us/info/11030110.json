  "Text": "Dates don't mean anything to me anymore. Only I and a young man survive. Why am I keeping this diary? I don't know. Maybe someone will discover my diary someday? But what good will it do?<br>The young man mentioned that the rock wall here seems thinner, suggesting that if we tried to dig together, we might find a way out. However, he's currently leaning against the rock wall, his eyes tightly shut, and he hasn't moved for hours.<br>I lack the courage to check his breathing. I feel terrible. My body is burning up, and my head is aching as if it's about to explode. I keep hearing Yōu's voice. Perhaps she's here to relieve me from all this pain.",
