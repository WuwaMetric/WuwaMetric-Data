  "Text": "Greetings, dear friends! It's your old friend Riddle Master D! Or you can just call me Mr. Riddle!<br>Since you've managed to make it this far, then it means that you're just one step away from my deepest secrets. \"Oh, the horror! My deepest secrets! I must not let that happen!\"<br>Gotcha didn't I? Well, quite the opposite! These challenges are placed here specifically designed for curious minds such as yourselves! Enjoy the thrill of these puzzles to the fullest and uncover the treasure I've hidden within!<br>Oh, goodness. I almost forgot to give you a bit of a hint. Don't want to have you test out each one individually. No, no, that won't do. Now, time for everyone's favorite, the hints:<br>The mechanisms are marked in four colors: red, green, blue, and yellow. They are numbered one to four based on the order in which they are supposed to be activated. Only one of the following hints is true, study them wisely:<br>(1) Mechanism No. 1 is red.<br>(2) Mechanism No. 2 is purple.<br>(3) Red and purple cannot be activated back to back.<br>(4) Mechanisms No. 1 & 4 are neither blue nor purple.<br>Rather simple, right? Better hop to it then! But do keep in mind, that you've only got five minutes to solve this puzzle! Muahahaha!",
