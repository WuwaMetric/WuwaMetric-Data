Whichever you prefer!<br>Oh, hold on, I've already mentioned that in the previous message. Anyway, there's always the possibility that someone might have missed the previous one and actually finished all 24 attempts before finally getting in. You'll never know!<br>Anyway. Sorry if you feel disappointed, but as you can see there's no treasure here. Not in the form of riches or anything like that at least. Instead, I have left you with something you may find even more delightful: \"Riddle Master D's Latest Horror Riddles—Ultimate Collection\"! This masterpiece is the culmination of my life's work, the one and only existing piece in this world! I’m sure this is exactly what you've been searching for!<br>Hmm? Not interested in books? Only treasures of glistening gold and silver have the power to spur that unyielding heart of yours, you say?<br>Ahem. Well, I figured as much... In that case, I believe this is a matter that calls for Riddle Master D’s credo: The true essence of a riddle lies not in the reward it conceives, but in the very process of resolve it entails! Did you not enjoy the thrill of the riddles? You would be lying to yourself if you said no. Then that's all that matters, is it not?<br>I hope you enjoyed yourselves. Until next time!",
