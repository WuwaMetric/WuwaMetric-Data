  "Text": "Dad and Mom always take different paths when we go hiking. Dad likes heading up to the summit, and I enjoy climbing with him. After reaching the top, we sit under a big tree and count the stars in the night sky. Mom, on the other hand, always goes down the mountain. Today, I decided to go with Mom.<br>I didn't even know there was a village at the bottom of this remote mountain! Everyone there smiled and nodded at Mom like they knew her well. Does Mom come here for her job all the time?<br>The villagers gathered around and thanked Mom, expressing their praises, just like those mentioned in the newspapers. But I also heard them say something else.<br>\"I wasn't sure if Dr. Xiangli Yan would really give us checkups for free every month, but she did it! And she still does, even after the big disaster...\"<br>\"She's so sincere and considerate. But don't you think it's a waste of talent for her to work in our village? I mean, someone of her expertise should be doing more important things!\"<br>On the way home, I couldn't shake off what the villagers had said, even finding myself muttering those words. Mom noticed and took my hand, asking about counting stars with Dad. I told her I could recognize every star, even the faintest ones in the distance. Mom said even though she wasn't up on the mountain with us, she was still gazing at the stars. The difference was that she kept her feet firmly on the ground so she wouldn't fall while looking at the sky. As she spoke, a man came up to her asking for help, so I went home alone. But this time, the starry sky looked different from what Dad showed me back on the mountaintop.",
