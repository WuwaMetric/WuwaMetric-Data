  "Text": "It suddenly dawns on me that I've been copying her paintings for over a year now. I've employed the same rendering technique, the same wrinkle method, and the same composition. Yet, my paintings lack her vividness, their visions unsteady as well. My Forte mirrors hers closely, only that her work conjures more vibrant and stable visions. I could achieve the same. Once I manage to conjure visions with the same vividness, people will recognize me as the best painter!<br>...<br><br>Mr. Baici, a man who has collaborated with numerous renowned artists, came to visit me. He had heard that I, too, could create paintings that summon vivid illusions. He came to express his admiration and encouraged me to continue. At first, I thought someone had finally recognized my talent. But his true intention was to recruit me into his shady business, buying all Forte works for dubious purposes. I had heard of the Shanyun Art Exchange, but never imagined their dealings would be so unscrupulous. While I did copy those paintings for practice, the choice of what and how to paint was mine alone. These dealers think they can buy me—what a joke.<br>...<br><br>The Shanyun Art Exchange sent me an authentic painting so I could study the vision's frequency. They claim they have superior methods to help me achieve the desired effect if my own Forte fall short. My Forte is not inferior to hers. They simply haven’t seen its full potential. Yet, with the authentic work in hand, progress would indeed be swifter.<br>Their condition is that I collaborate with them and hand over all my copies. These paintings are mere stepping stones to my success, destined to be discarded. So, why not accept their terms? I don't care what they do with the paintings. They assure me they've been conducting such transactions for years without incident. With such a powerful patron, there should be no trouble.<br>I'll do anything to make it happen.<br>...<br><br>Having an authentic work in my hands makes all the difference. The frequency fluctuations of the painting have allowed me to glimpse her energy. I need to examine her original painting once more. A perfect replica is just the beginning. One day, I will be the only painter capable of bringing paintings to life, surpassing even her achievements.<br>...<br><br>Why do my paintings still fall short after all this time? They lack her artistic depth! Wait—I think I understand. If I use their method to alter the painting's frequency, I might be able to achieve it...<br>...<br><br>Mr. Baici is truly a connoisseur of art. He says my recent works are nearly indistinguishable from the original. Some have even exhibited power beyond the original piece. I knew it. The gap between us is merely a slight difference in ability. With their technical support, my Forte has easily reached the next level. Surpassing her should be simple, let alone mere replication.<br>...<br><br>No, something is wrong... Why do my paintings attract Tacet Discords? The visions are more unstable now. How is it that her painting has none of these problems? There's something amiss here. I... I just want to surpass her! I never meant to harm anyone! The Shanyun Art Exchange is still not giving me a clear answer... This was not our deal!<br>...<br><br>I'm tired, truly, deeply tired...<br>I won't create any more paintings that harm others.<br>This isn't what I wanted!<br>But they have evidence of what I've done and won't let me go...<br>What should I do? What should I do?<br>Can anyone help me... anybody...<br>I’m not afraid of being caught anymore... As long as I can get out of this...<br>Help me...",
