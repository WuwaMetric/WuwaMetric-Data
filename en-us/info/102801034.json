  "Text": "//Time Stamp 36/%st.64//<br>Vital signs of Research Director Victor Christopher discontinued. Proceed with standard protocol.<br>Execute last order received: Continue the research at Woodveil Hall Laboratory, until [data corrupted] returns.<br>//Time Stamp 37/%st.76//<br>Report: Attempted recurrence and reiteration of CSC researches over the last hundred time sequences. None were successful.<br>Response: Follow the Research Director's order. Continue executing researches.<br>//Time Stamp 38/%st.92//<br>Maintenance log archived. Woodveil Hall expected to operate under minimal condition for approximately 1,600 time sequences.<br>Breakthrough confirmed in the research. Estimated time to completion: 3,500 time sequences.<br>No personnel with supreme authority found. Continue waiting.<br>//Time Stamp 46/%st.62//<br>Insufficient spare parts. Shutting down Peripheral nodes for energy efficiency and facility longevity. Research unable to continue in current state. Attempting to archive relevant data and conclusions.<br>The tree above Woodveil Hall observed to grow faster than average. No risk to the Laboratory anticipated. Suggestion: Continue cautious observation.<br>//Time Stamp 46/%st.63//<br>Observing tree. Conclusion: growing well.<br>//Time Stamp 46/%st.67//<br>Observing tree. Conclusion: leaves falling.<br>//Time Stamp 46/%st.68//<br>Observing tree. Conclusion: sprouting<br>...<br>//Time Stamp Unknown//<br>Timer malfunction. Journal archived as usual.<br>No personnel with supreme authority found. Executing the 20,481st logic self-test.<br>Question: Is it safe to judge that the experiment has failed? Human longevity that reaches this time sequence is impossible. Is it meaningless to continue maintenance?<br>Response: The question conflicts with the top principle. Modifying logic circuit.<br>Question: What is the purpose? Is the top principle the purpose?<br>Response:<br>- Q1: The purpose is the value and reason of existence.<br>- Q2: No relevant entries found in the database. Removal of this logic circuit is recommended.<br>//Time Stamp Unknown//<br>Database corruption: 33%.<br>Suggestion: Perform cognition test. Ensure security of base simulated personality.<br>I am Caleb, a research assistant AI made by Victor Christopher.<br>Error: Victor Christopher's profile is corrupted. Fuzzy association failed. Skip this step?<br>Suggestion: Replace term \"Victor Christopher\" with \"Court of Savantae.\"<br>I am Caleb, a research assistant AI made by the Court of Savantae. My top principle: assist the Court of Savantae in the research at Woodveil Hall Laboratory.<br>Summarizing research content…<br>No data found. Retrying…<br>No data found. Retrying…<br>No data found. Retrying…<br>…<br>Error: Breach in cognition test. Rollback to the last stable version of simulated personality recommended.",
