Oh, excuse me...<br><br>...Target data has been imported into Tethys, and the Stellar Matrix in question is temporarily designated as No. 001. The Matrix's equatorial coordinates in the Tethys System range from 08h 07.5m to 09h 10.7m in right ascension, and from 15.12° to -0.08° in declination...<br><br>According to our observations, Stellar Matrix No. 001 contains at least two pseudo-stars with a Lament magnitude exceeding 2.0. This means the source of our target data was destroyed by at least two near-catastrophic events, consistent with our observations.<br><br>Detailed data on 001α and 001β will be available after the data source is processed by the Shorekeeper...<br><br>...<br><br>All our knowledge, whether past, present, or future, pales in comparison to what we cannot know.<br>Looking back at Solaris-3 from the starry sky beyond, it may look like a mere pale blue dot. <br>But it is also... our star. Our home.<br>Please, what should I do...",
