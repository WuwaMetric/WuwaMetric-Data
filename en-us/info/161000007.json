They merely appear beforehand.<br><br>...<br><br>Some ecologists argue that the creature's frequency dates all the way back to the Age of a Thousand Islands. Though rare, the species has endured, likely owing to their acute sensitivity to environmental changes. The antennae on their heads can detect subtle environmental shifts, allowing them to avoid danger preemptively.
