A new guy tried to ask me about the rumors surrounding the \"secret cache.\" It's honestly surprising how long these baseless rumors have managed to stick around. Even if there was some secret cache, it's not like that's something we Level 1 folks are supposed to care about.<br> <br>5:30 PM: Work is wrapping up for the day. On the Echo Train ride back, Jason thought it'd be fun to spook the newbie with one of those corny old ghost stories. Something about a mysterious, unmanned train that only runs at midnight and takes passengers to the Vault's \"underworld.\" There, spirits of the dead rip apart anyone who dares trespass in their domain. I've heard enough of these kinds of stories. If there really were any mysterious trains, I would've seen one by now.",
