  "Text": "Long ago, it was right at this solemn and sacred site of trial that the Blessed Maiden was bestowed Haultir, the Sword of Virtue. Now, in the same hallowed place, the Blessed Maiden raised the Sword of Virtue high, her gaze fixed upon the squire kneeling before her. The squire held his posture with perfect stillness, silent as a statue.<br> <br>\"Before our Master Imperator, do you vow to fight only for justice and righteousness, and to lend your hand to the weak?\"<br> <br>The squire could not speak. He answered with a slow, deliberate nod.<br> <br>\"Do you vow to remain steadfast in faith and oath, never to abandon the duties entrusted to you?\"<br> <br>Again, the squire nodded.<br> <br>\"Even should you find yourself in the most dire of trials? Even should you... face death itself?\"<br> <br>The squire uttered an indistinct sound. From the tone, it seemed to be an affirmation.<br> <br>The flat of the Sword of Virtue lightly touched Cadanto's shoulders—once, twice, thrice.<br> <br>\"From this day forth, you are a true knight, Cadanto.\"<br> <br>For many of the Acolytes witnessing the ceremony, this was the first time they had seen an <ano=Divine envoy>Echo</ano> rise to knighthood.",
