  "Text": "...What's so special about the Court of Savantae Ruins? If you ask me, those people from the Court of Savantae were no good. Dead though they may be, their excessive protection measures still got several of my brothers killed. Tsk, I don't get why those people from Fractsidus are so obsessed with the moldy books and scrap metal of the Court of Savantae. All they have done over the last three days is dig up the ground and move the Court of Savantae's junk out of the ruins. I wouldn't humor them at all if they weren't paying so well.<br>—Yao Shisi<br><br>Reply to Yao Shisi<br>Are you really that crazy about money, or do you have a death wish? The Fractsidus are a ruthless bunch who will swallow you whole. Why not just search Mt. Firmament for something valuable and sell them in Jinzhou instead. That way you'd make a pretty penny, too.<br>—Kui",
