Those gangsters aren't idiots. Why would they hide their loot in such an obvious place? It's gotta be a Chest Mimic that somehow found its way here from the sewers. If anyone finds this note, <color=yellow>DO NOT TOUCH THIS SUPPLY CHEST</span>.<br>I'll ask Talos to come check it out when she has time.",
