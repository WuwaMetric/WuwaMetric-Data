  "Text": "The Dim Forest is unquestionably the most significant treasure trove in the entire Huanglong region, boasting unparalleled species richness in the world.<br>Upon setting foot at the entrance of this gate, I could distinctly hear the plants whispering and their summons.<br>It is said that deep within the forest, the former site of the Department of Ecoacoustics holds image records of numerous plants, including a delectable species known as Ivory Banana, originating from the Dim Forest. Ivory Bananas were once a primary food source for Hoochiefs, and, in return, Hoochiefs exploring the forest in search of Ivory Bananas became excellent pollinators.<br>Since the spread of the toxic spore mist, wild Ivory Bananas have disappeared from the Dim Forest, and information about this species can now only be found in historical records.<br>The Lament might be an inevitable process of natural selection.",
