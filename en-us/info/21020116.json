  "Text": "We ultimately failed to find a way to mass-produce enhanced Echoes. So, this Statue Echo may be the only significant result we were able to achieve. What's worse is that our own Echoes are no match for it in combat, so we haven't been able to collect any combat data.<br> <br>The Family has decided to abandon the research and have us return to work at the Vault. However, I can't help but feel that this deserves a better conclusion. So, I've left behind some equipment capable of collecting combat data, which will be automatically saved to the Vault's server.<br> <br>Whoever finds this, I hope you'll try giving it a go with the Echo. This way, we'll be able to obtain crucial data… Perhaps in the future, this data could be applied to practical use within the field of Echo research.<br> <br>I've also left some rewards behind. If you succeed in defeating this Echo, they are yours to claim.",
