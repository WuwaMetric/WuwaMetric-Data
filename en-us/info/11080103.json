  "Text": "After bidding farewell to the Violuna Banyan, I proceeded towards the most important target—the Central Banyan.<br>It's a tree towering into the sky, with a large spore cloud perched at the top, spreading toxic spores with the wind.<br>Any creature approaching this tree exhibited obvious anxiety and fear—the white toxic spores floated around the Central Banyan, almost blocking out my sight. I could even hear faint coughing from the forest. I needed to take every step with extreme caution from now on.<br>The closer I got to the Central Banyan, the more uneasy I felt—there was a heavy snorting coming from its hollow, and the vibrations caused by breathing shook off the spores accumulated on the branches. As more and more spores fell down, I tightened my filter.<br>These creations of the Waveworn Phenomenon are infiltrating our world, making everything dangerous and unfamiliar.",
