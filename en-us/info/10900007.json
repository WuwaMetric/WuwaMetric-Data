  "Text": "I recently received an invitation from the Pioneer Association to explore the culinary delights of Jinzhou. Eager to embark on this food journey, I wandered through the city's streets, savoring every dish the city has to offer. My journey led me to uncover delightful surprises that have now come together to form this unique booklet—a comprehensive food map of Jinzhou. I hope that as you read these pages, you will feel inspired to embark on your own food exploration—then my hard work is worth it. For it is in the moment when flavors dance upon your taste buds, igniting a symphony of sensations that resonate deep within, that the true essence of these delicacies lies.\r<br><span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Panhua's Restaurant</span>, rating: ☆☆☆☆☆\r<br>While writing this booklet, I found myself seated at a small table at Panhua's Restaurant, enveloped by the vibrant buzz of lively conversations. It was here that I witnessed a heartwarming gathering involving a Patroller who had just completed her duty, her friend wearing a blue beret, and another friend in an icy demeanor. Before the Patroller could sit down, she swiftly placed an order for Poached Chicken, Perilla Salad, and Maocai before being joined by her friends. They shared anecdotes with each other, and the vivid expressions and gestures of that Patroller made the atmosphere even more lively. This experience makes me confident that Panhua's Restaurant has the ability to provide a relaxing and spirited dining environment, making it a standout choice for any culinary enthusiast.\r<br>\r<br>As I penned these words, the Poached Chicken arrived at my table. While the chicken itself appeared flat, when immersed in the restaurant's specially crafted sauce, it provides an unforgettable flavor. As I savored each bite, the meat juices burst forth, accompanied by a fresh aroma that lingered in the mouth. The accompanying vegetables, stir-fried to perfection, boasted a vibrant green, complemented by sizzling oil droplets. Paired with tender and fluffy rice, the dish left me with only one word in my mind—\"delicious\". \r<br>\r<br>So I couldn't resist having another serving:)\r<br><span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Jewel Boba</span>, rating: ☆☆☆☆\r<br>I found myself longing for more as I savored the delightful Jewel Boba, each sip leaving me yearning for another taste. If I had a second stomach dedicated solely to desserts, there's no doubt it would be reserved for the delicious dessert soup offered here in Jinzhou.. And if I were to recommend just one, Jewel Boba would undoubtedly be my top choice. Boasting over thirty years of renowned excellence, this sweet treat remains as delicious and affordable as ever.\r<br>During my visit, I ordered the new buy-one-get-one-free dessert soup. The owner told me that its launch was inspired by a happy couple celebrating their anniversary at the shop—the owner, pleased with their happiness, presented them with a specially made drink. As the couple highly praised its taste, the owner decided to share its taste to more customers. After listening to this warm story, I, who was holding two cups alone, couldn't shake the bitterness of coming here alone. Luckily, the sweetness of the Jewel Boba somewhat lifted my spirits.\r<br><span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Liuxian Teahouse</span>, rating: ☆☆☆☆\r<br>Liuxian Teahouse boasts its Bittberry Tea with distinctive bitterness, which forces you to question everything with a single sip. However, beneath the initial shock, a subtle sweetness emerges, with great persistence in the mouth. \r<br>Unlike the bustling Panhua's Restaurant, Liuxian Teahouse provides a tranquil atmosphere where one can recline in a chair, fan in hand, and while away the hours immersed in the peaceful embrace of life unfolding around them.\r<br><span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Borderland Cuisine</span>, rating: ☆☆☆☆☆\r<br>...",
