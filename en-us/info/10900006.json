  "Text": "As I grow old and reflect on my life, I am haunted by the regret of not fulfilling a legend someone once told me. They said that if the most important person in your life is willing to fulfill this legend, your relationship will be blessed by the heavens until death do you part. I missed my chance and have always felt like we were just passing through each other's lives.<br>But now, as I face my impending death with only regrets, I feel compelled to find the place where we promised to meet and fulfill the legend. Even though it may be too late for me, I hope this notice can reach young people who still have a chance to hold onto their loved ones. So please, kind lady at the Pioneer Association, share this unknown legend and perhaps someone can finally solve its mystery.<br><span class=\"font-bold\">Under the crescent moon, we roam<br>On a screen court, stars dance and moan<br>Timeless, by this heart-shaped lake<br>Together, hand in hand we take<br>Starry-eyed, our love shall never break.</span>",
