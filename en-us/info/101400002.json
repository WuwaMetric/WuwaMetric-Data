  "Text": "Date: [--16]<br>Assembling machinery in a modular way... this \"Automata Mechanics\" is quite something. Thanks to it, we easily built our new lab. Of course, we couldn't do it without the financial support of that Fractsidus Overseer. Annoying to have someone meddling in our research, given his generous contributions, it's all tolerable.<br>After all, no choice left. Got expelled from headquarters, so the only way was to move to the Whining Aix's Mire. Sure, the workload increased, but there's an advantage. No one's gonna bother coming to this remote place.<br>I still remember the moment Professor Heisen announced the trial's success at the meeting. He told us, \"I'm getting old, but there's still plenty I can do. And you, you're still young with endless possibilities. I believe each one of you, genius or not, would rather leave your mark in history than end up living an uneventful life in a place like this.\"<br>If successful, our names could be immortalized with Professor Heisen's in history, known for generations to come even as ordinary people.<br>We were once prohibited from research due to the so-called \"dangerous activities\", expelled from headquarters. We were resentful and frustrated. But now, we've let go of those pointless emotions, focusing solely on paving the way to the future.<br>Setting aside personal stories, I think, it's more because we've all witnessed \"miracles\".",
