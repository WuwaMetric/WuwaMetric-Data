  "Text": "Dear Hebenon,<br><br>The head of our family has always taught us that to be born into the Fisalias is to embrace coldness, decisiveness, and ruthlessness. <br><br>For the \"greater good\" our family upholds, personal sacrifice holds little weight. As the eldest daughter, it is my duty to uphold these teachings. While our ways may seem harsh, they are accompanied by the weight of expectations and the honor of our name. I have resolved to relinquish all personal desires, allowing the family's code to seep into my very soul.<br><br>Our impending duel will undoubtedly bring pain, yet we have both come this far. I trust we will become exactly what the head envisions for us. You, too, are a daughter of the senior line, and I implore you not to follow in our cousin's footsteps, who defies the head's will.<br><br>Gather your strength and determination, so that when we face each other in the trial, we shall do so as equals.<br><br>Should I become the Maiden, I will honor your sacrifices. And if you are chosen, I hope you will do the same.<br><br>Yours,<br>Mandragora",
