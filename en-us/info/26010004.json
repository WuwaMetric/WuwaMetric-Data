The wounds are deep... I probably won't see the dawn. But no one said you have to write some famous last words when you're dying, right? We can all relax about it.<br><br>I wasn't able to find the legendary treasure of Three Heroes' Crest, but... you're not entirely out of luck. There's a simple challenge. A puzzle. I've hidden my life's savings in a secret hideout in the hunting grounds.<br><br><span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">It's located beside the House of Prophecy, beneath the Hornett.</span><br><br>Go and have a look if you're interested. That shall be... the treasure I leave for fellow explorers.<br><br>Blast it, my vision... It's beginning to blur. Best of luck to you.<br> <br>Cheery Peso",
