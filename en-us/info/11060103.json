  "Text": "Today is November 8, and we have been ordered back to the rear to reorganize. The rumbling of artillery at 91.7 is constantly heard, and there is no doubt that that height will be the key to the whole battlefield. Whoever mastered it there gained the initiative.<br>Flesh and blood became the strongest line of defense on that high ground, which was not many square feet, and before which all steel had to bend the knee.<br>I was glad I didn't borrow the platoon sergeant's new clothes, at least we could bring him home with dignity.<br>He told me a legend that his grandfather told him. It is said that when a man leaves, in the dead of night his returning spirit will be carried back by the breeze to find his own home. Now that it's late at night, I wonder if everyone has already set off on their way home?",
