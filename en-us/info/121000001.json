  "Text": "April 8<br>The doctor recommended Fuling receive palliative care at home. Fuling smiled and explained that it wasn't about losing hope, but rather a chance to finally visit the magical destinations we've always talked about exploring together... I understand her illness is serious, but as long as it brings her happiness, I'll support her wholeheartedly. And me? Well, I'm not one to give up without a fight.<br><br>April 15<br>Fuling asked me to map out our journey, and she took on the task of delving into success stories of her illness, pinpointing potential treatment spots. A few of the locations she picked were incredibly isolated. I was worried she wouldn't make it to those places. However, she brushed off my concerns with a carefree assurance, claiming she was perfectly capable and full of vigor.<br>Not wanting to dampen her spirits, I agreed and promised to take good care of her.<br><br>May 1<br>The famous doctor we visited in Mingting said she couldn’t do anything about Fuling's rare symptoms.<br>It's okay; we have other options. There must be a way to cure her.<br><br>May 30<br>Despite everything we've tried, we haven't found a treatment that can fully cure Fuling. Her condition has worsened, and the illness has made it difficult for her to travel long distances. To cheer her up, I rented a hologram projector from the Pioneer Association for her. She enjoyed the projected scenery, but I couldn’t ignore the yearning and sorrow in her eyes. She concealed them well, but I sensed them, and it pained my heart.<br><br>June 13<br>Fuling, in her gentle way, had requested snapshots of the landscapes I stumbled upon during my travels. She believed that by seeing these images, she could somehow accompany me on my journey. Despite her well-meaning gesture to console me, her absence left a void that tainted even the most breathtaking views with melancholy.<br><br>June 15<br>Encountered a Tacet Field on my path today, diverting me onto a detour that led me to a hidden lake nestled deep within the forest. <br>The sight before me was beyond words—the wind carried petals from the trees, creating a mesmerizing dance of colors in the sky. My camera failed to capture the fleeting magic of that moment. Enthralled by the enchanting view, I momentarily lost touch with reality. <br>Yet, as quickly as joy enveloped me, sorrow and fear washed over, realizing that such beauty held no meaning without her presence beside me. <br>It felt like fate as I journeyed in search of a cure for Fuling, passing through places we had once dreamt of exploring together. Some spots were meant to surprise her during our planned adventures. <br>If only Fuling were here, her artistic touch would breathe life into these places once more; even the most desolate ruins would flourish under her paintbrush.<br>...If only she were here with me.<br><br>June 16<br>I encountered a strange man in red today. His pretentious attitude put me on edge. Despite my unease, he shared a weird story with me, almost as if it was intentional.<br>He knew I was seeking a cure for Fuling and claimed to have a way to save her. However, he only revealed half the truth and insisted on me doing him a favor before sharing more details. Honestly, I'm not sure if I should trust him.<br><br>June 17<br>My next destination is Jinzhou, the home of a painter Fuling admired. She is so excited about this. I haven't seen her like this in a long time.<br>I've discovered the true identity of that man in red. Apparently, he belongs to a dangerous organization that I shouldn't meddle with, but...<br><br>June 20<br>The information shared by that man and his organization was beyond anything I could have imagined. The truth behind that tale, the Sentinel's power to manipulate time, the secret realm in Mt. Firmament... if they are all real, then Fuling can be cured.<br>According to the deal I made with them, I need to use my identity as an adventurer to find a certain object hidden in the mountain, and this object, as they promised, is the key to saving Fuling's life. They seemed unusually obsessed with it, but their intentions were none of my concern. All I need to do is keep Fuling alive, and for that, I'll pay any price.<br>I must give it a try.",
