  "Text": "\"Project Echo Reborn\" Meeting Record<br><br>- Many TDs inherently possess consciousness. Even after being cut and bridged, their chaotic consciousness persists. That means they still tend to evolve by absorbing Reverberations after being stabilized into Common Echoes. While we've managed to suppress their absorption instinct post-frequency cutting, preventing their chaotic evolution, but to fully eliminate their consciousness...<br><br>- Perhaps we should change course and create entirely new consciousness modules. We can implant only the consciousness we need into the Echoes, forcibly overriding their original consciousness. The power They granted to us allows this. I've tested it.<br><br>- Overwriting their consciousness will only further destabilize the Common Echoes and disrupt the established methods of their creation.<br><br>- I think there might be a solution. The new consciousness module could be planted deep within the Echoes' original consciousness, functioning only when needed. In the meantime, we can continue researching how to improve the stability of consciousness transformation. But there's one thing, if the deeper consciousness is activated, it would be irreversible.<br><br>-We must delay activation indefinitely until we can ensure the Echoes' stability after alteration.",
