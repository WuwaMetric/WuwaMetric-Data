They likely were left behind during a previous supply transfer.<br><br>There are no records related to these chests in the Vault, so their ownership is unverified. The Precious Metals and Artworks Depository has also refused to accept them.<br><br>The Echo Depository has no use for these materials, and they take up space here… but for now, there's no other option but to continue storing them here.<br><br>(Below the note, in a different handwriting, a hastily scrawled line reads)<br><br>These are not Vault assets. Whoever wants them can take them.",
