After I drank it, I felt a little better, just enough to write to you.<br><br>You might wonder why I'd ever drink something from a Fisalia, but don't worry. I've been keeping an eye on her. She's… different from the others. They don't seem to like her much, and she's always by herself, mumbling and grinding herbs. What she said last time wasn't a lie, and she didn't hurt me. <br><br>Maybe… not all Fisalias are bad.<br><br>I'm thinking about asking her for help. She knows so much about medicine, and since she doesn't fit in with the rest, maybe she'd teach me how to mix the right potion to help Jojo. I know it's risky, but if there's even a small chance, I have to try.<br><br>Oh, and one last thing—security is tighter now, so be very careful, okay? If you hear three quick knocks, that'll be me.<br><br>Yours,<br>Chloe",
