  "Text": "Record No. 0595 (Internal) <br>Submitted by: Tifareth Felix Gluck <br>BS 037/1/99388* <br>Tethys ID: K-125 (Decommissioned)<br>——TOP SECRET——<br><br>...After importing the target data into Tethys, the Stellar Matrix is assigned the designation No. 1712. The Matrix's equatorial coordinates in the Tethys System range from 02h 11.6m to 03h 09.7m in right ascension, and from 10.11° to 7.18° in declination...<br>Observations indicate that Stellar Matrix No. 1712 contains at least two pseudo-stars with a Lament magnitude exceeding 2.0, suggesting that the target data source was destroyed by at least two near-catastrophic events, consistent with the actual situation.<br><br>Detailed data on 1712α and 1712β has been submitted based on the conditions at the Port City of Guixu, as well as other reports under the BS 037/1 catalog. It is known that 1712α is simultaneously affected by severe gravitational anomalies and non-naturally occurring harmful vegetation... 1712α is currently in a stable state, with its mass, charge, and angular momentum parameters uploaded to the Tethys system.<br>...<br>...<br>I am uncertain why Tethys shows such interest in 1712α. It might contain information about the Lament, but I cannot be sure. The fact remains, many lives have been lost in that city—Brandon, Hoda, Tilly, Jiyue...",
