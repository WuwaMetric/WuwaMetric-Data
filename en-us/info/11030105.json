  "Text": "July 5<br>The platform was swarming with people. All in chaos. I was overcome with fear of being separated from Yōu, so I abandoned one of our bags and hold onto Yōu's hand tightly. Thankfully, we successfully boarded the train.<br>There was a foul smell inside the carriage, as if something was rotting. The lights flickered on and off and the door was broken as well, almost trapping a young man's arm. I wondered if a broken train like this could truly lead us to safety.",
