  "Text": "Today, the captain had another discussion with me. He hoped that, as a technical backbone, I could provide a decisive opinion on whether the exploration work could still be completed as scheduled. Both he and I, and even everyone else, understand the importance of excavating the second long-distance transportation route. This route, starting from Jinzhou, passes through the Gorges of Spirits to connect the remaining areas in Huanglong. It is important for Jinzhou to have closer and more convenient interactions with other territories in Huanglong. To put it bluntly, in case there are issues with one transportation route in the future, we can still rely on the other, avoiding falling into a desperate situation.<br><br>Recent monitoring indicates the potential emergence of Tacet Fields around the Gorges of Spirits at any time, but we can't stop now as we have already come this far. If we stop now, all our hard-earned achievements will be in vain. However, if we don't stop, we may risk the lives of our team members.",
