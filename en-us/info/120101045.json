  "Text": "Literary works draw their vitality from two sources: The creator and the readers.<br><br>The creator gives it new life, while the readers help extend it through reading. Each time they share a piece of work or publish their thoughts and reviews, they breathe new life into it.<br><br>Some may find the term \"life of a work\" elusive, as it's too abstract and intangible.<br><br>However, a parallel can be easily drawn from human life. When discussing the concept of life, one essential topic is inevitably brought up—name. A name is a symbol of existence, one of the most important markers that separate individual lives. If one desires to feel the vitality of a work, the most direct approach would be to feel its name, the various names bestowed by creators and readers.<br><br>I once heard an eerie tale from a land in the east that spoke of a lady with skin as fair as snow who would stand in a snowstorm, cradling a wailing baby in her arms, begging the passersby to hold the baby for her. If some kindhearted individual agrees to that request, they'd soon find themselves unable to let go, bound to freeze to death.<br><br>Intriguing, isn't it? But, by this point, it's a fascinating tale that evokes many distinct images that cannot yet form the entirety of \"life.\" <br><br>But what if we give it a name? Like... \"The Snow Woman.\" This name alone captures the entire narrative and defines its essence.<br><br>However, even with the name anchoring people's imaginations, the unusual nature of words means each person takes a narrative differently.<br><br>Hence... The life of a creative work is less controllable than human life.<br><br>So, if one day, people's understanding of a work is led astray, then words could turn into a devastating weapon.<br><br>What would we do then? Show anger? No, absolutely not! Anger is the cheapest outlet of dissent. As creators, all we can do is believe. Believe that our words can live in their most genuine form.<br><alignright/>—Exclusive interview with the Golden Anthem",
