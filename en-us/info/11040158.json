  "Text": "The social behavior of Hoochiefs is even more astonishing than imagined, establishing them as the dominant species in the Dim Forest.<br><br>According to my survey, the toxic spore mist constantly spreads outward from the Central Banyan. To avoid the invasion of those spores, Hoochiefs disperse into different groups, seeking refuge in various safe zones, gradually forming communities characterized by \"paternalism\". The intelligence displayed by those Hoochiefs seem to be unique among Tacet Discords. Besides, near the Hoochief communities, sightings of activities from other Tacet Discords are notably scarce, which I attribute to a possible manifestation of \"territorial consciousness\". This consciousness prompts Hoochiefs to take different jobs and collaborate in repelling intruders from their territories.<br><br>What makes me even more curious is the response of a community if a Hoochief becomes contaminated. I am left wondering about the decisions such communities would make in such a scenario. Along the frequented path of the Feilian Beringal, I caught a glimpse of some grave-like mounds. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to examine them carefully.",
