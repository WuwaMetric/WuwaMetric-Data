But it was far worse than I could have imagined.<br><br>May 11th - We were sent to Norfall Barrens to investigate Threnodian Crownless energy, but the Wuthering Waves only made things more difficult. The constant rain blurred our vision and we could barely see where we were going. General Jiyan gave us a potion to block out the strange whispers we heard in the weather.<br><br>May 13th - Our team was starting to feel overwhelmed as members fell one by one. For the first time, the idea of retreating crossed my mind. Thankfully General Jiyan recognized our distress and allowed us to rest in some ruins for the night. We found a book of jokes that helped ease our tensions, but General Jiyan still seemed worried.<br><br>May 20th - Wuthering Waves concentrations were no longer important because all data was meaningless. We were suffocating in this environment, and in our latest battle, everyone died except for me and General Jiyan. He sacrificed himself to save me from the TD army. I couldn't do anything but watch as he fought alone, his star mark flickering from overuse of his Resonator powers. I begged for help while hiding behind him, not wanting to die. In the end, General Jiyan half-knelt in the ruins while his lance stood tall, saving my life.",
