When he returned to the camp, his companions were astonished, for this \"Dragon Slayer\" bore upon his body more than a hundred wounds, large and small. He had clearly endured some dreadful battle, a trial beyond imagining.<br><br>The gladiator smiled wryly, admitting his defeat. Many remember this as the first failure of the \"Flawless Hero.\" His second failure—the tragedy of Fabianum—would follow not long after.<br><br>That gladiator was Magno, the former Ephor of Septimont.",
