  "Text": "15:23. It's been five full hours since I entered the Tower. Nearly half of that time was wasted, because I took the wrong path forward.<br><br>My watch is almost entirely covered by moss. It spread so quickly. There's no doubt now. Time inside the Tower flows differently from the outside… No, the entire city of Honami is out of sync. I passed through countless time fragments, saw my tenth birthday party cake, the balloons and flowers from my coming-of-age ceremony, and the lab coat I first wore when I joined the Black Shores.<br><br>It was happiness. Surreal like a dream… But I couldn't let myself get lost in it.<br><br>I took off my protective gloves and ran my fingers across the corroded surfaces, trying to touch the reality in front of me. Surprisingly, it felt warm, like the vein of some living creature.<br><br><span class=\"italic\">(The writing wavers here, as if the hand holding the pen had started to shake.)</span><br><br>…Or maybe that warmth was a hallucination born out of being so cold.<br><br>My mind is slipping, but I can't stop now. I knew from the start this would never be an easy path... <br><br>But so what? Even the most dangerous equation still needs someone willing to solve it.",
