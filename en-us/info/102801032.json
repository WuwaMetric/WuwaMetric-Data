  "Text": "//By Bram<br>I have seen my end. Before death arrives, I... must repent.<br>I am not a pure scholar.<br>I envy my colleagues... Victor, Alaia, Vasily, Chen Xuefeng... They all have ideals, and beliefs. They sincerely hope that their efforts will better humanity. They want to surmount the Lament and ward off crises.<br>I am different. I work for selfish reasons, masquerading my ambition as ideals like theirs. I joined the research on Retroact Rain in Whining Aix's Mire and then relocated to Mt. Firmament, all to prove that time is a river. We are merely carried along by it and someday we will also find a way to go against the current.<br>Like a drowning man, I grasped at any straw, seeking salvation where none exists... Isn't it ridiculous, Vivian?<br>I don't know why I have you in my mind at this moment... Or should I say... you never left. The miracles at Mt. Firmament once fueled my unrealistic fantasies. I sacrificed everything and exhausted all the knowledge I had acquired throughout my life, just to bring you back from the dark, hazy underworld, and hold you in my arms once again.<br>But I failed. My fingers started to tremble, my head grew dizzy, and I could no longer operate those delicate instruments. I see you now, standing by the river, separated from me only by a thin veil. I've been drifting down, and down, and down... But you, you stayed somewhere upstream, for eternity.<br>Fortunately, I won't have to worry about this much longer. I'm about to run aground, and I hope I have the chance to sail upstream and find you.",
