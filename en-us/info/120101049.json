Just one minute before the observation was complete, a dark rift suddenly tore open from the device in front of me, shredding the stream of data across the screen. My boots were still stuck to the lab floor, but my upper body had already been pulled into a strange, chaotic storm.<br><br>That was the beginning.<br><br>Now I find myself in a city I don't recognize, having just survived a bizarre Lament. It slices through buildings, people, space, everything two-dimensional, three-dimensional… and maybe things beyond that, though my eyes can't quite make sense of it anymore.<br><br>My Forte is Sealing, something that might be considered a way to resist the passage of time. Maybe, if I keep trying, I can use it to record the abnormalities in this city and figure out how to break through it.<br><br>I'm not going to sit here and wait for the end.",
