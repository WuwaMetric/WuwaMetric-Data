  "Text": "Do not bring flowers to my grave, for I am not there, bound under this tombstone.<br>I am in the sea winds at Ragunna's walls. I am dawning lights that break through thorns.<br>I am a night hawk of wings aflame, soaring towards the Celestial Steed, whose praises I sing and whose true form I behold.<br>The night sky will be illuminated by wings aflame, and I shall be reborn in immortal poetry.<br>So long as people draw breath, lift your eyes and see: so long as this poem lives, it breathes life into me.<br><alignright/>——End<br><br>Looking back at what I wrote in the preface:<br>This anthology is attributed to the Golden Anthem. We wish these poems might offer a glimmer of hope to those lost in fate's journey, and to readers something to contemplate.<br>Gather these scattered golden syllables, as they are treasures tempered by fire, and lingering sparks of human thought.<br>And finally, thank you for opening this book.",
