  "Text": "Precautions for Induction Energy Storage Module<br>    1. Operators should pay attention to the fact that the different colors of the Induction Cell correspond to different voltages and must be matched with the corresponding energy storage slots.<br>    2. The voltage of the Induction Cell can be changed through the variable sensing device to meet the demand.<br>    3. Due to lack of maintenance, there may be obstacles near the module, which should be cleared before use.<br>    Example:<br>    Ruins (can be cleared directly)<br>    Bush Trap (can be destroyed by bursting Tacetite)<br>    Tacetite (can be destroyed by activating Tacetite Lightning)",
