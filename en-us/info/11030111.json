  "Text": "The ground is covered with broken rocks and gravel. The traces of digging spread across the broken rock wall, accompanied by trails of aged brown bloodstains. Faint glimmers cast their eyes through the crevices, throwing specks of light onto the saddened ground. Placing your hand on the rock wall, you exert a gentle force. With a thunderous roar, the rock wall gives way, releasing a gust of fresh air that rushes in, breathing new life into the train carriage once more.",
