  "Text": "Dear Mandragora,<br><br>My dearest sister, I cannot fathom anything more heart-wrenching than facing you in this trial, given all the years we have spent growing up together.<br><br>As the Fisalia eldest daughter, you were always sheltered, yet you took it upon yourself to welcome me into this world with such tenderness. I still recall the way you would sew my clothes, even adding that little pink bunny design. It was so soft and fluffy, far more lovely than any strange creature from the deep.<br><br>If the Fisalias can have only one Maiden, I wish it to be you.<br><br>To show my sincerity, I'll share my newly awakened ability with you. My tears are lethal. They paralyze people upon contact and then clot their blood.<br><br>I swear by the name of Fisalia that this is true.<br><br>Please think of a way to counter my power. When the time comes, I hope you can free me from this fate.<br><br>Yours,<br>Hebenon",
