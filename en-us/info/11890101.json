  "Text": "This is the location where the last trace of the research team was left at the time. We conducted a large-scale Sensor in the neighborhood and found some stray Acoustic Print.<br>Preliminary analysis of the Acoustic Print composition. It was found that part of it had been left for a long time and was already blurred, while the other part was very new. Could someone else have been here recently? We'll have to wait for further analysis before we can draw any conclusions.<br>......<br>According to the results of the detailed analysis of Acoustic Print, the composition of the old Acoustic Print was very mixed, with not only those researchers at that time, but also a large number of traces of TD's activities. With the number and average strength of the research team against a TD of this scale, they were afraid that not all of them had disappeared, but had been martyred in the line of duty.<br>Although the new Acoustic Print is much clearer, there is unknown interference that prevents it from being accurately recognized, but judging from the comparison results, they should all come from the same person, and the time span is quite large, and it seems that this person came here many times after the accident. A similar frequency was also found in the old Acoustic Print, and it is speculated that he may be the only survivor in the research team. Not only did the survivor not report the accident, but he also came back here repeatedly, so what exactly was the purpose?<br>......<br>Tacet Field has been unusually active lately, always feeling unsettled, as if something is about to happen ......",
