  "Text": "It's been a while since I had such an intense workout.<br><br>The contaminated Hoochief exhibited an astonishing lack of fatigue in their relentless pursuit of its prey—unfortunately, that prey was me. However, when escaping, I didn't feel panic and my brain started racing. I was well aware that the toxic spores are a direct consequence of the Waveworm Phenomenon. Based on the Ecoacoustics standards, how should we classify those contaminated Hoochiefs? Furthermore, how do those toxic spores contaminate Tacet Discords and is meditation a viable solution for Tacet Discords contamination?<br><br>Utilizing the Grapple function, I skillfully swung onto a hidden branch. The contaminated Hoochief lost track of its target and scanned around in confusion. It looked like a lost kid, whimpering and coughing, and it seemed to lose spatial perception. Each intense cough released a burst of toxic spores into the air. The spores, driven by their innate instinct to propagate, further pushed the already weakend body of the Hoochief to its utmost limit.<br><br>I started wondering: is it a form of co-evolution, or does it represent a parasitic relationship?",
