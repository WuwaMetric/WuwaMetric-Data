  "Text": "Work Overview: The initial phase of mapping for the distribution of the Exploration Units has been completed, allowing for a preliminary determination of the orientation for constructing a new route leading to the inner Huanglong. While collecting image data, the survey team encountered a small-scale onslaught of the Tacet Discords. As the special operation forces of the Midnight Rangers provided timely support, only two team members sustained minor injuries. However, the exploration equipment suffered heavy damage.<br><span class=\"italic\">New equipment is scheduled to arrive one week from now. Until then, all exploration activites will be temporarily suspended.</span>",
