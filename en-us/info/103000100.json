  "Text": "Applicant: Gardner, Monica<br>Application Type: Clearance Application<br>————————————————————————————————————————————<br>Body Text: <br>A causality assessment of the collected data confirmed a normal distribution, with no significant anomalies detected. However, during real-time regional information monitoring, unnatural frequency fluctuations were observed, specifically associated with the access doors.<br><br>To verify these findings, a 48-hour real-time data investigation was conducted. Access to the Black Shores system database enabled the correction of anomalous entries and the isolation of a dataset exhibiting characteristics linked to the access doors. Hypotheses were subsequently formulated, followed by a regression analysis and re-simulated modeling based on historical data and relevant theories.<br><br>For comprehensive details, please refer to the appendix. Key conclusions from the data analysis include:<br>1. The intensity of abnormal frequency fluctuations of the access doors is strongly correlated with the sequence in which they are activated.<br>2. The peak frequency band of these fluctuations bears a high similarity to the high-frequency range of the overlapping section in the current Necrostar frequency history.<br>3. The transient model of these peak frequencies shows some resemblance to the transient model of an Overclocked Resonator connected to the Black Shores' Terminal.<br><br>Based on this, the report confirms that the rumors hold some validity. Among the filtered data, the highest correlation of abnormal frequencies is linked with the grouping of <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">Lower Levels of the Hall of Foreign Affairs—Haven of Sprouts—Platform of the Hall of Foreign Affairs</span>.<br><br>While no field tests have been conducted yet, further study of the <span style=\"color:#ffd12f;\" class=\"font-bold\">sequence and pattern of access door usage</span> may yield significant insights in the next phase.<br><br>Additionally, during the on-site investigation, I re-verified the relevant movement path, which was frequently used in past Black Shores debriefing processes. Given Conclusion 3, I suspect this event may be connected to certain historical incidents at the Black Shores.<br><br>...In light of these findings, I believe that any potential lead towards locating missing employees warrants serious consideration. Therefore, I formally request higher-level permissions to access historical data for further investigation.<br>————————————————————————————————————————————<br>Approval Status: Rejected<br>Approver: Tethys System<br>Approver's Comment: \"The Necrostar presents a significant hazard. Investigating its associated frequencies could exacerbate these risks. Clearance is therefore denied.\"",
