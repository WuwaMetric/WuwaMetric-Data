  "Text": "Dearest Father,<br><br>I am writing this letter to you from a corner of the library. Over time, I have slowly adjusted to life at the seminary. During my free time, I often come to this library to read the ancient texts it holds and study the doctrine of Unity. But the deeper I delve into the history of Rinascita, the more I sense that it is shrouded by an unresolved mist. There are too many unanswered questions about our faith, the grace we have received, and the disaster that once befell us.<br><br>Fortunately, many publicly sensitive topics and even discussions of taboos are regarded as subjects of academic interest in the seminary. I will take time to study and explore them. Of course, I haven't neglected the swordsmanship Mother taught me. Recently, I applied for sparring practice with the Divine Envoys... Don't worry, I won't hurt myself.<br><br>I remember you once told me that Avinoleum is so vast you'll always get lost. This year, I've walked everywhere in the seminary, except for those places where I'm not allowed to go. I've drawn a <span class=\"font-bold\">simple route map</span>, which is easier to read than the one in the Order. I'll send it to you later.<br><br>With my sword and lantern, I press on through the fog.<br><br>My Lord Imperator from above,<br><br>Rosalie",
