However, I must admit, I too have been misled by the superficiality. For a long time, I've been attempting to improve the antibodies, hoping that they can aid us in exploring the Dim Forest more efficiently. I also aimed to use them to cure Hoohoo. Yet, my research has yielded no results so far. What should I do? It appears that Hoohoo's time is running short. It's more than a Tacet Discord but a true friend. The antibodies I make merely postpone its symptoms and fall short of a complete cure. Is this contamination irreversible? Can I find a way to neutralize it?<br>...Recently, I discovered that the purified spore cores we've extracted no longer contaminate their surroundings, so I tried to add them to the antibodies. Hoohoo showed no adverse reactions after taking them, and its health condition even improved. Perhaps this time, I've successfully made an effective antibody! However, there's been a surge in spores nearby lately. That's not a good sign...",
