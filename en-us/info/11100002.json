  "Text": "To whoever reads this,<br>I hope someone still remembers me and has the painting I'm looking for. My son drew it years ago, and it captured the beauty of our once peaceful home. Back then, we used to come here often to admire the bridge and the garden full of colorful flowers. My son loved playing among them, watching the riders pass by with their heroic determination to deliver supplies while dodging the burning flowers that grew too fast.<br>But now, the bridge is broken, and our side is no longer safe. I had to send my wife and son away to find shelter while I stay behind as a rider, risking my life to prevent the fire from spreading further. I may not be much of a man, but I want to be a hero in my son's eyes.<br>I've also enclosed some dried flowers that I planted myself. They won't catch on fire like the others, and if I survive, I hope to see this place restored to its former beauty without fear of fire. But if something happens to me, please know that I am proud of what I have done and wish for you all to live in peace and see these mountains flourish with safe and beautiful flowers again.<br>Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. My thoughts will be with you and this place until we meet again.",
