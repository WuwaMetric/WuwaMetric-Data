  "Text": "Date: [--25]<br>We have succeeded. The TD numbered A038 has survived the artificial Tacet Field. Though the outcome may be somewhat underwhelming, now is not the time for nitpicking.<br>The days on duty are so unbearable. I have to stare at this dark mass all night long. It neither moves nor makes a sound, making the nights even more tedious than my stern supervisor. To maintain stability in the Tacet Field, Professor Heisen had removed all the clocks. Sigh, every minute and second feels like eternity. The usually amiable Professor Heisen is unexpectedly strict this time. Since the experiment began, I had hardly seen him smile. By the way, a researcher had accidentally brought a tool with a frequency exceeding the standard into the experiment environment last time, causing a huge commotion. The entire research site sounded the alarm. Fortunately, the Tacet Field and A038 seemed unaffected. However, the size of that mass seemed to have increased slightly. I don't think it made any difference. However, it was the first time I saw Professor Heisen angry.<br>Alright, I should stop here for today. There are still many issues to resolve. All the parameters and data language established lately have to be typed out manually, and everyone is working around the clock, though none complains. After all, without overwork, where else can we geniuses and maniacs go?",
