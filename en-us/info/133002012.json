  "Text": "The Dark Tide is a Waveworn Phenomenon native to Rinascita. It manifests as a dark, swirling mass of clouds that gathers and eventually breaks, pouring down in torrents like a waterfall. Wherever the Dark Tide strikes, it spawns Tacet Discords, and the area around its point of origin becomes a new Tacet Field.<br><br>There have been two significant Dark Tides in Ragunna's history. The first, according to the Order of the Deep, was stopped by Napoli II, the first Primus of the Order. The second was quelled by the martyrdom of the Blessed Maiden Fleurdelys.",
