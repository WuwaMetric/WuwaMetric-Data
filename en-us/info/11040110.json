  "Text": "Dear outsiders, if you find stray cats at the Gate entrance of the transit station, please do not feel free to feed or call them.<br>There are two bullies in the neighborhood who often approach the staff with the gesture of a soft loved one, and take the opportunity to sneak into the station and hide in the shadows of the important equipment. When discovered, they open their teeth and claws again, deliberately injuring people, and have been repeat offenders!<br>In order to ensure the safe storage of Tacetite products as well as your personal safety, please be careful of the two bullies and don't be fooled by their appearance.<br><br>**We have people who feed them at regular intervals.",
