  "Text": "Here's Shiyu's stamp of approval: Shixia has officially reached the summit where this letter resides!<br><br>Shixia just got accepted into the top school in Jinzhou, and she's set her sights on working at the Ministry of Development. I couldn't be happier for her, but also a bit envious of her drive and success. Meanwhile, I still have no idea what I want to do with my life. Shixia keeps bragging about how she'll pass the exam with flying colors, but let's be real, she studies all day and night while I'm out having fun on vacation. She's like a mountain climber, reaching new heights with every achievement. Good for her!<br><br>Despite Shixia's initial hesitation, she ended up crawling up the steep terrain alongside me. And after reaching such great heights together, it was clear she wouldn't back down easily. Thankfully, she got into Leyi Academy, otherwise her legs would have been permanently stuck in her bedroom from all the studying. I've never seen someone with so many textbooks and a consistently lit bedroom for a whole year... the school bully must be terrifying! But Shixia seems to be enjoying herself. <br><br>I just don't understand why she's suddenly in a bad mood after acing the exam... I should take the chance to ask her, since she’s busy enjoying the scenery right now.",
