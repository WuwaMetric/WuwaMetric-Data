  "Text": "Date: [--02]<br>The <ano=CSC>Court of Savantae</ano> Laboratory is an abandoned site in the Whining Aix's Mire. Due to the use of specialized materials developed by the CSC in the main structure, the building is well-preserved and undergoes minimal weathering and corrosion. After a risk assessment, the research committee decided to use the lower levels of the site to create an artificial Tacet Field for experimental purposes.<br>There are a few abandoned devices left in the experimental area. Low-frequency lighting systems are positioned at specified distances and angles, ensuring consistent illumination in the experimental area.<br>At the center of the experimental area, multiple bundled cables secure a spherical metal device. These cables also transmit input and output data from the spherical metal device, and identical frequency detection devices are arranged around the spherical metal device. <br><br>These devices are typically operated with dial plates. Clockwise rotation increases electric energy, causing a metal frame to rapidly rotate around the central device for frequency detection.",
