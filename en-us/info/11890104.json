  "Text": "Experimental Environment:<br>Experiment Number A038 is assigned a 6m x 6m x 6m artificial controllable Tacet Field. Environmental checks for the artificial Tacet Field are required every 6 hours.<br>To avoid impacting the subject, experiment personnel entering the designated area are prohibited from bringing in devices and tools incompatible with the standard specifications.<br><br>Detailed Record:<br>Initial observations confirm that A038 Tacet Discord, born in the artificial Tacet Field, can survive stably.<br>Subject has yet to exhibit specific physical features or simulate vocal behaviors. It lacks a physical form and can only be observed through specialized means.<br>Currently, A038 shows no clear behavioral objectives: mostly in a stationary state with low aggression and activity.<br>Due to significant deviations from expectations, further research is necessary.<br>Note: High sensitivity to frequency observed. Strict control of the standard frequency specifications in the experimental area is required.<br><br>Due to the unique nature of A038, we need more time to re-establish corresponding parameters and data language to gain deeper insight of its information. Considering our current technology and correlated data, this process will take a considerable amount of time.<br><br>Warning: Leakage of experimental information through any means is strictly prohibited.<br>Taking photos or recordings of subject without Professor Heisen's permission is strictly forbidden.<br><br>That concludes the records of initial observations.<br>To obtain more information on subject, future experiments and analyses are necessary.",
