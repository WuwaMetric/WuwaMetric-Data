But how do I make sure everything goes according to plan? Aha, I've got it—keep the enemies close, just like with secrets. For the <color=yellow>first two digits</span>... I'll go with the <color=yellow>number of trees and chandeliers in the hall</span>. As for the last two digits, that's on Barolo. He took forever setting up the balloons in the hall yesterday.
