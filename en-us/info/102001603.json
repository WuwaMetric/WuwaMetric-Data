I've completely mastered the Photonvault.<br>Comment: The Court of Savantae is nothing but a bunch of sanctimonious hypocrites. Such a powerful device should be used as a weapon, not a decoration or a toy. To not let their efforts go to waste, we must use the Time Stasifier in our plan. That should bring them solace in the afterlife.<br>Record 03-44: Team C has been ordered to take the Time Stasifier to Camp 1 to capture the escaped entity.<br>Comment: Don't mess it up this time.<br>Record 03-52: The escaped entity has been captured. Team C will go to Xuanji Ridges to start preparing. Team D has been sent to Camp 1 to assess the damage and recover materials if the opportunity arises.<br>Comment: That person called Ogo in Team D always manages to mess things up. If he screws up again, have him lead the experiment. I guess this counts as making the most of things.<br>Record 03-53: A message has been received from Ogo. He encountered the Rover at Camp 1. No signs of involvement from the forces of Hongzhen have been observed yet.",
