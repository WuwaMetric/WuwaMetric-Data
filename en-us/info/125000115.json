  "Text": "Lupa gazes at you intensely, her eyes sparkling with passion.<br><br>\"I swear by the eternal sun.\" It's more than a promise, but a testimonial to the lone wolf's raw loyalty and sincerity. She may be yet another soul you salvaged in your long journey. But for Lupa, she's found something she never had—something that offers the long-awaited release of her anguish and pain. You'll never know what that is, and she won't tell you either. But that's all right. For both of you, this is enough.",
