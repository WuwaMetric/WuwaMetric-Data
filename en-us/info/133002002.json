  "Text": "Ragunna City, the administrative center of the Ragunna city-state in Rinascita, is a thriving port city by the sea, its districts linked by winding waterways. The Ragunnesi are devout followers of the Sentinel, who believe Common Echoes to be gifts from the Sentinel carrying Their divine will.<br><br>In addition to their faith, the people of Ragunna are also known for their love of the arts. The city is adorned with magnificent sculptures and paintings at every turn, and impromptu performances often bring the streets to life. Under the leadership of Fenrico, the current Primus of the Order of the Deep, a series of laws have been enacted to restrict certain themes in artistic expression. These laws have sparked divided opinion among the city's inhabitants.<br><br>At present, Ragunna's daily affairs are overseen by the Order of the Deep, while prominent families such as Montelli and Fisalia also hold significant influence over the direction of the city.",
