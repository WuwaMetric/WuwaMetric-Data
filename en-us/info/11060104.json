  "Text": "On November 15, we waited to provide support, two recruits in all. Counting the 12 men left over from before, we formed a squad. Since we were still a platoon, I was the acting squad lieutenant, nominally an acting platoon lieutenant.<br>The battle of 91.7 had depleted the reserves, and it was time for us to return to the battlefield with the remnants of our incomplete formation. Our troops are penetrating to the enemy's rear, just waiting to complete the encirclement so we can completely annihilate the enemy.<br>The enemy has also realized this and intends to make a desperate attempt to break through our defenses and counter-encircle our two flanks. The fate of this battle will soon be decided.",
