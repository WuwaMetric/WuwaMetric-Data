  "Text": "Every Gladiator in Septimont knows this place. It's where we hunt and test our mettle.<br><br>The dragon corpse lying out there draws in all sorts of TDs, beasts, and glory-chasing Gladiators like us. I've no doubt Flavio was here. I saw his breastplate in one of those old halls. His family sigil was split in half, perhaps his way of cutting ties with his House. I also couldn't help noticing the dents and gashes all over the armor, some deep, some just scratches. To us, those are medals.<br><br>Locals say this battered piece once belonged to a man who tamed a damn dragon, a Scourgewing. Faced it alone and made it submit to his will. While I was drowning in ale over my sister's death, Flavio was out in the wilds conquering with his sword. No one knows where he went with the dragon, but I know he's walking the path toward glory... He's becoming a legend.<br><br>A pack of Gladiators swaggered past me, fully armed. I overheard them talking. They were tracking a Scourgewing near the Border Mountains. But unlike Flavio, they weren't after a duel, only a dirty hunt.<br><br>They'll probably haul it back to the city and sell it off for a good price. That's all it is to them.",
