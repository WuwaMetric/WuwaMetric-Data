  "Text": "<s>Fenrico's devotion, wisdom, and determination are sufficient for him to become a second significant Priest in Avenolium.</s><br><br><s>Unfortunately, compared to the other one, he seems to lack spiritual insight and flexibility…</s><br><br>Impossible, impossible! So long as I study hard and practice what we preach, I WILL stand before the Divinity someday.<br><br>Is it not right to take the sacred Codex in its most literal form and apply these truths to every aspect of society?<br><br>These teachings are the only authoritative truth. I must still be lacking the full comprehension. But once my understanding is clear enough to uphold these truths, They will surely understand. They will surely see me.",
