  "Text": "One of the most powerful, and certainly the oldest and most traditional, families in Ragunna, renowned for their expertise in medicine and poison. Their devotion to Sentinel Imperator is clear to all who know them.<br><br>A faction within the Fisalia family believes that the Montelli family's embrace of openness and the privatization of Echoes is a direct affront to Imperator's teachings, threatening to lead Ragunna into an abyss of heresy. They have directly opposed the Montellis through various means, shaking the family's longstanding image of dignified respectability. Yet, the head of the Fisalia family residing in Porto-Veno Castle seems disturbingly indifferent to the repercussions of these bold and provocative actions.",
