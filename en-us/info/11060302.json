My sister and I just want to visit the sea of flowers over there.\" The larger boy looked at me sincerely, but I was momentarily stumped.<br>It's just that, who doesn't have a bit of curiosity when they're young. Anyway, I haven't gotten much lately, so why don't I just accompany them to take a look, just as a chance to go to Sea of Flames.",
