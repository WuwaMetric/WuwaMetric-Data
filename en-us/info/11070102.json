  "Text": "Last month, while taking inventory in the yard, I spotted a spider web. Normally, I would have cleared it but this one was different. Its intricate design drew me in, with expanding polygons that seemed to follow a calculated pattern. It reminded me of a legendary tale - that TDs are attracted to similar frequencies. In that moment, I felt a connection to the spider and its creation. I couldn't bring myself to destroy it, hoping no one else would disturb its beauty. I wonder if the spider and I share a similar frequency?",
