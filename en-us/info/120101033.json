  "Text": "...Later, I came to realize that we were \"blessed.\"<br> <br>The people of Rinascita said that whale guided ships and sailors who perished at sea to the afterlife, like a ferryman of the underworld. I heard that the merchants of the Forgotten Sea could weigh memories and souls on their scales, exchanging them for an equal weight of gold.<br> <br>But for some reason, we're all still alive. Or rather, we exist in a state between life and death.<br> <br>Yes, in time, I found Starbuck and Queequeg on this island. They're still alive. \"It,\" the whale they call \"Cetus the Tidebreaker,\" was also still alive.<br> <br>How can this be a \"blessing\"? This is nothing but a \"curse!\" I cannot accept this!<br> <br>Once I've had my vengeance, death may take me. But if my vengeance fails, I cannot bear to remain in this world as a mere plaything for those I sought vengeance against! My fate is mine to decide, and only true death can end my conquest.<br> <br>They don't understand. That whale, though it appears tame and gentle, is cunning and violent. It transforms death into an unjust eternity, making my vengeance just a footnote in its mockery of the sea… No, I will never accept this. I will never compromise!",
