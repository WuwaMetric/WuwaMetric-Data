  "Text": "The Carnevale must be canceled to safeguard the authority of our Order and to strengthen the foundation of our faith.<br><br>Only then will the Blessed Maiden be gone forever. Without her meddling, I shall lead Ragunna to a better future.<br><br>Merely delivering the Oracle is simply insufficient to earn people's trust. I must step back, foment a disaster, and perform an act of salvation.<br><br>When this year's liner is sunk by the behemoth monster of the sea, and the tide washes up horrific casualties, they will understand the punishment I speak of. Only then will I call upon divine power to halt the disaster. As the curtain falls on this spectacle, they will see the truth with their own eyes, and in that moment, all will trust me unreservedly. The masses will instead cheer as I cancel the Carnevale.",
