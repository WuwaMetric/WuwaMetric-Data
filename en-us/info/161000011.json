All I ever cared was your dream. You, more than anyone, deserved to stand in the Colosseum and become a champion. But you gave it up for a dying woman, and tarnished all you and your friend held sacred.<br><br>Whatever comes next, please take care of yourself. Whether you return to the arena or choose another path, I only hope you find happiness. May my wish travel with the winds to your side.<br><br>Your family, always",
