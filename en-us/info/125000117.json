  "Title": "<span class=\"italic\">The Septimont Tribune</span> Special Issue",
  "Text": "This special issue offers a detailed look at the legendary figures who once shone brightly in the history of Septimont. <br><br>From Fabius and Atilius to Valeria, tales of the Hero of Heroes occupy half the pages.<br><br>The remaining half pays tribute to those who never wore a crown, yet gave everything for the glory of Septimont. Many met their end in the hunting grounds—names like Tercules, Magna, and Taurus, lost to time, yet remembered still.<br><br>In contrast to the lyrical prose favored by Ragunnesi writers, the style here is bold and unadorned. Yet, the punchy words always evoke the most epic imagery. Though born of the same origin, the voices of Rinascita's isles have long diverged in art and expression.",
