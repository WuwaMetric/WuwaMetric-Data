  "Text": "After the Fisalia family established the Sentinel faith and positioned themselves at the core of the religious structure, an increasing number of people in Ragunna began to dream of a fish imbued with divine presence. This phenomenon was especially common among the fishing communities who often went out to sea. When fishermen prayed to this fish in their dreams, their prayers were answered—sometimes with a more bountiful catch, other times by safely avoiding an approaching storm...<br><br>These accumulating small miracles over time gave rise to a new faith. While practitioners maintained their devotion to the Sentinel, they increasingly directed prayers to the dreamt fish, drawn by its tangible blessings.<br><br>Fearing crackdowns from the Fisalia family, followers of this new faith dared only to spread their belief within a limited circle among the lower classes. Yet as more discovered their shared worship of the same divine fish, a new clandestine group arose.",
