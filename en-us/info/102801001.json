  "Text": "We went beneath the banyan tree, where darkness shrouded Grandma and me.<br>Grandma led me with knowing grace, to hang the moons in their rightful place.<br>A glowing orb above the leaves, banishing shadows, making forest so bright.<br>Moon O moon, where do you hide? <color=yellow>Behind a waterfall's cascading slide?</span><br>With gentle hands she'd guide my head, as we gathered moons before bed.<br>Moon O moon, where do you roam? <color=yellow>At the moon pool's alluring home?</span><br>Moon in hand I came back and read, by her side she taught me to heed.<br>Moon O moon, where do you rest? <color=yellow>Perched upon a tree stump's crest?</span><br>Naughty Hoochiefs watched in glee, trying to catch the moons so free.<br>Moon O moon, where do you play? <color=yellow>In a cave where dry branches sway?</span><br>All moons gathered but she was gone, leaving me an everlasting dawn.<br>I gazed at golden moons so bright, and left for the city that very night.",
