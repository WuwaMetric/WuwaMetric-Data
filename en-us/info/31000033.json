  "Text": "Entry No. 18<br>1. Status of suppression device: Reactivated. Functions, overloading. Rate of fog suppression only at 34.265%.<br><br>2. Data analysis and additional notes: Recent suppression results, unsatisfactory. Suppression rate continues to decrease. If the power of the suppression device is not further amplified, it is only a matter of time before we lose suppression effectiveness and experience a further spread of the fog.<br><br>However, considering that the effectiveness of the suppression device has already received two increased adjustments, as well as the changing of the fog's intensity from weak to strong, further increase would only result... It feels as if the fog's source has engaged in a match of tug of war with us. <br><br>No, this isn't possible. Judging from the frequency band drawn, there are no large life forms within the fog area, but... Is it really possible? Must a life form be identified by humans? We have been unsuccessful in making actual contact with the source of the fog up till this day, thus we cannot completely rule out the existence of human intelligence.<br><br>In addition, I have read Shi'er's log (not that I wanted to. It was only because he came looking for me), and I believe that additional manpower and equipment should be allocated to further survey the movements of the Mourning Aix.<br><br>I have not witnessed the creature's behaviors inside the fog area like Shi'er did, yet I have seen it perform frequent circles and landings within proximity of the deceased avian Tacet Discord. It still possesses longings for the avian Tacet Discord and has lost its sanity because of it.<br><br>Similarly, I still hold the speculation that avian Tacet Discord bears human emotions and human intelligence.<br><br>Normally, we would be led to believe that the harmony between the two Tacet Discord is nothing more than a simulation of some form of biological behavior. Yet I have witnessed... During the Tacet Discord Outbreak, one of the creatures dragged its dying partner to safety as it let out a mournful cry toward humans.<br><br>It gave a shrilling cry as it kneeled down seeking the humans for help. At that moment, I seemed to have seen its \"soul\", one that is no different from a human (I am aware that this is an emotional expression inappropriate to this recording, but I insisted on its inclusion.).<br><br>Recorder: Qiqi, SR-461",
