You always have such unique ideas.<br>Painter: I thought it might make you angry.<br>Ma Cui: My temper has improved since my daughter came into my life.<br>Painter: She seems quite gentle and kind.<br>Ma Cui: That's not true. She's always been courageous.<br>Painter: She doesn't like her given name, Ma Xiaofang.<br>Ma Cui: And what does that mean to you?<br>Painter: That she may struggle with facing herself.<br>Ma Cui: It's not easy to confront our own weaknesses. But I know my child. She will become the bravest of heroes.<br>Painter: What if she had the chance to save you but failed because of her fears?<br>Ma Cui: ...<br>Ma Cui: Mr. Painter, are you being serious?<br>Painter: Absolutely.<br>Ma Cui: In that case, I would be honored to witness your exceptional fortune telling skills. But I believe you are mistaken about my daughter.<br>Painter: About her fate?<br>Ma Cui: No, about her character.<br>Ma Cui: If such a moment were to arise, then my passing will mark the beginning of her heroic journey.<br>Painter: Why do you say that?<br>Ma Cui: Because I know my child, and one day she will prove to be the bravest of heroes.<br>Painter: Mr. Ma, you are certainly an interesting man...
