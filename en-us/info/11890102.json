  "Text": "March 23rd.<br>I still can't accept ...... them, so many people, all because of me ......<br>I heard that the former couple had a daughter and that child is now an orphan. A whole family ...... It's all ruined because of me!<br>No ...... this won't work ...... I should go find that girl, or at least not let her grow up alone. I can't let myself carry more sins.<br>......<br>May 12<br>A lot has happened lately. I was worried that an official investigation would come after me, but then suddenly TD Outbreak broke out and the investigation was closed. Hurray!<br>Kyauk is a smart girl, the only thing she's not smart about is that she trusts me too much. When I said I was her distant uncle, she believed me and was very close to me.<br>I thought taking care of Kyaw Kyaw could alleviate my guilt, but I didn't realize that the more she trusted me, the more guilty I felt. After paying so much The Price to Pay, not only did I fail to get the secret treasure, but I was also immersed in guilt the whole day, Yu Kuo Xing ah Yu Kuo Xing, what kind of thing have you lived into?<br>......<br>(The date data further back seems to be corrupted, only some intermittent statements.)<br>......<br>I went back to the research camp to look at it, but because of the TD Outbreak rampage, the terrain in that neighborhood has shifted a bit and it's hard to find the entrance from back then. It's been so long in the past that I can't recall the exact location.<br>......<br>I'm getting more and more unable to face Kyaw Kyaw, she can already take care of herself, or just let her think I'm missing.<br>......<br>I paid so much The Price to Pay, how can I get nothing? I am not willing, not willing ah!",
