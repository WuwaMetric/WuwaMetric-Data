  "Text": "Before I came to Huanglong, I had heard about the magical \"mushrooms\" that grow here.<br>It is a huge red-colored coral that grows among the steel jungle. It reproduces very fast and has strong hallucinogenic ability, so it can be said that it is the real master of this city ruins. After the sea receded, the Huanglong people thought they could regain their homeland, but they were attacked by the evolved corals - a psychedelic scene called \"mirage\".<br>No one knows what the first group of investigators saw - the past or the future? Those who barely escaped lost interest in everything and soon died of hunger strike. The reconstruction of this place was abandoned as a result.<br>Only one day, the crimson suddenly faded, and with it a sharp decrease in the amount of crimson capsulein in its emitted spores, as if their growth period had suddenly ended, but will it still evolve? Will there be new dangers?<br>For the time being, no one but the Exiles, who don't value life, are willing to enter this ruin of the unknown.",
