Both the ████ system and this unit confirm this assessment.<br><br>Over the past ████ years, the disaster has destroyed over 80% of effective man-made structures and killed more than half of the global population. After all countermeasures proved ineffective, the ████ system and this unit began feasibility testing of Plan 3 based on the Tethys Institute's report.<br><br>Throughout these ████ years, we have successfully completed the observation, containment, and analysis phases, thus meeting the preliminary conditions required for Plan 3. However, recent data indicate that time ripples generated by the disaster are converging on our current spacetime, with the disturbance intensity increasing in direct proportion to temporal progression. Projections suggest that within ████ years, this disturbance will result in a 15-degree negative deviation from the baseline, likely surpassing it.<br><br>Under these circumstances, Plan 3 poses a significant risk: Event A within this spacetime could become an absolute outlier from Event O, severing the causal connection between the two. Such an outcome would be catastrophic, leading to the permanent disconnection of Event O from Event A.<br><br>████████████████ ████████████████ ████████ ██████████████████████ ……<br><br>Upon entering the execution phase, Instances One and Two will be activated to assist in controlling time and space, respectively. Instance Two, developed from our research on the Sonoro Theory, is particularly optimized for spatial control.<br><br>…No, emotions are unnecessary for her function. That is redundant for our purposes. As long as she endures, once we become an absolute outlier, all other concerns will be irrelevant…<br><br>As for Instance Two, the Tethys system will oversee her management. There is no need for further concern in that regard.",
