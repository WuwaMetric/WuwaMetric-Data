It's in a transparent bag and looks kind of like Midnight Wonder Cup Noodles. <br>IF YOU FIND IT, CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY! REPEAT: DO NOT CONSUME!<br><br>[From \"FoodAndResearchAreMyLife\"]<br>Oh no… I already ate it. Thought it was cup noodles my labmate left me. Is it toxic?? Bio, mineral, synthetic neuro-??? Do I call medical or start drafting my will??<br><br>[From DoNotEatIt]<br>…It's not toxic. I spent over a month making that stuff, added a customized nutrient mix, and in previous animal tests it helped control weight and temporarily boosted physical metrics. But the synthesis yield was abysmal. That was the only cup… and I was planning to test it on myself.<br><br>[From \"FoodAndResearchAreMyLife\"]<br>Ah... I see. Sorry, I was starving after an all-nighter.<br><br><br>[From DoNotEatIt]<br>Then congratulations, you're now the test subject. Send me your weight and grip strength data every 72 hours.<br><br>[From \"FoodAndResearchAreMyLife\"]<br>Copy that.",
