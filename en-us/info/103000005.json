Despite working with authorities and assisting with evacuation efforts, I can't shake this feeling of being too late.<br><br>...It's now 3 PM. We have reached the skyscrapers in the city center, with flames lighting up the northeastern sky. The bridge there seems to have collapsed as well.<br><br>We stumbled upon a specialized unit, led by the formidable \"Ironclad\" Brandon, making their way towards the heart of the Lament-infested zone. We must advance higher... Those dangerous red flowers emerging, they are pushing us towards the skyscrapers, but... the Lament's core is right above us. That... black hole.<br><br>This is a war of attrition... Many of those who found us were already beyond saving...<br><br>The time is... what, 6 PM? It should be 6 AM. The next surgery is about to start. We are currently gathered in a meeting room on the upper floors of the skyscraper. At this point, we can't afford to be too meticulous. We'll need at least three Peregrine-class gliders to evacuate everyone.<br><br>...Only thirteen atropine doses remain, and it's getting hotter here. We are struggling to maintain the patients' body temperatures.<br><br>Support! Aerial support! Headquarters! Requesting assistance! Coordinates have been sent to Tethys—support!<br><br>...At the very least... evacuating the women, children, and elderly...<br><br>It's getting hotter. Brandon and his team haven't returned... Requesting support...<br>...<br><br>I can't... give up hope...",
