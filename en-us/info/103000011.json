  "Text": "Landmark Building Faces Environmental Concerns? Expert Assures Central Spire is Safe<br><br>With the completion of the Central Tower, many worry that this over one-thousand-meter skyscraper might harm the environment or cause structural issues. Professor Anderson, an expert from the Architecture Institute, provides some clarity.<br><br>“We conducted a ten-year study on the site's soil and groundwater,” says Anderson. “For such a massive building, we had to ensure the site could support its weight long-term. Our research shows the geological conditions here can sustain the building for over a century, with minimal tilt and settlement.”<br><br>Anderson also mentions the use of new materials, allowing the foundation to support a building up to two thousand meters. “However, the current height meets all needs.”<br>Regarding concerns about shading, Anderson adds, “We ensured a fifty-meter distance between the tower and nearby buildings. The upper levels are designed in a spiral to maximize natural light.”",
